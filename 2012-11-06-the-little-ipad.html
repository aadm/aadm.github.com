                <p>I wrote something about this little iPad <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-07-19-ipad-mini-needs.html">a while ago</a>, and on reading again that piece I find that it still represent my thoughts today. Yesterday Apple held the official announcement and among other cool things<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> there was the iPad&nbsp;mini. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m disappointed by two things; first is the lack of the retina display, but I now understand what&#8217;s at stake here (and I can&#8217;t believe all the tech commenters do not realize this): you want the retina display, you need more power and more battery to feed&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The 3rd generation iPad was in fact a little disappointing in terms of performances compared to the non-retina iPad 2; to move all those pixels you need a beefier cpu and not just the slightly tuned A5. Now, with the 4th generation iPad and its <span class="caps">A6X</span> cpu, there&#8217;s (apparently) some serious power to move four million pixels around. If Apple had put a retina display on the iPad mini we probably wouldn&#8217;t have had enough battery life (assuming the <span class="caps">A6X</span> was used) or the display refresh would have been too unbearably slow (keeping the <span class="caps">A5X</span>).</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s obvious that one year from now there <em>will</em> be a retina iPad mini; in some secret laboratory around Cupertino  (or maybe on Tim Cook&#8217;s desk) propotypes of this little demon are already running 24/7. But we know that one year is the life cycle of these devices so I want to concentrate on this year&#8217;s iPad&nbsp;mini.</p>
<p>The second disappointment is the price: I was expecting to pay $250 for the base model, and I was willing to concede Apple the extra $50 compared to Google&#8217;s Nexus because of the more rounded experience that iPad currently offers. But $329 for the 16Gb model is too close to the price of the larger iPad 2. Will it stop me from buying it? No, because I wanted a smaller, more portable device; something integrated with my iPhone and my computer at home running <span class="caps">OS</span> X; something that I already know how to use and does not give me headaches<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> . But if I want to give a tablet to my mum for example, so that she can check my newborn daughter&#8217;s progress, I will not spend $329 and I will seriously look at some Android alternative<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the point is &#8212; what do you need a tablet for? I have already detailed my ideal needs <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-07-19-ipad-mini-needs.html">in the aforementioned post</a>, but to recap and recalibrate my ideas: I would need it (omitting the obvious internet/email things) to store and do a first quick review of photographs, when I&#8217;m away from home for some extended period of time; to work on my writing (I use very often Byword on my iPhone and I&#8217;m sure that doing so on a larger display would help immensely); for sketching and reading and annotating PDFs (I have always been unable to read PDFs on a computer screen, but doing that on an iPad is slightly more convenient)<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Yes I know, all boring and conventional stuff, something that I am pretty certain that an iPad mini will allow me to do easily. <br />
But what about something new, something that could really alter a photographer&#8217;s workflow, and maybe improve it? Back in 2010 I had <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2010-08-03-ipad-and-photography.html">an idea about using a tablet to help a photographer&#8217;s work</a>. Later on, I found that my ideas/dreams were realized by some <a href="http://www.photosmithapp.com/">clever</a> <a href="http://pixelsyncapp.com/">folks</a>, but very little is made of these apps when discussing iPads/tablets and photography, and the usual story is about using the tablet as a portfolio&nbsp;viewer.</p>
<p>So I ask myself, is there something else I could use an iPad for? how do skilled photographers (not tech-nerds, because I don&#8217;t want to end up reading the equivalent of using iPhones for shopping lists) use their tablets&nbsp;for? </p>
<p>For example, there&#8217;s this Google &#8220;Guy&#8221;<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>  that <a href="https://plus.google.com/111962077049890418486/posts/CJuo23L5Nb7">likes his Nexus 7</a>. Another article called <a href="http://connect.dpreview.com/post/2693143833/ipad-3rd-generation-workflow">&#8220;The iPad Workflow&#8221;</a> was recently published on Dpreview Connect; there are some good points but nothing too outrageously&nbsp;inventive.</p>
<p>But apart from that, is there some more interesting stories about for example a real editing workflow example for photographers? I guess I will end up using the iPad to watch some movies after all, and photography will be still made with a camera and a normal&nbsp;computer.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t care too much about the iMacs (even though they look amazing) &#8212; I prefer to have my display separated from my machine. The Macmini is still my favourite Apple desktop computer; I have been a happy Macmini user for a long time, the first one was the original powered by the PowerPC G4, then a Core 2 Duo 2.66ghz which I still have it running as my media player running <span class="caps">XBMC</span>. The problem with the current Macmini is that the quad-core version is a bit too expensive. What I care about is the Macbook pro 13&#8221; with retina display, really appealing for my current heavy Aperture use. For the moment however I&#8217;ll hold on to my old Macbook Air 11&#8221; and my Hackintosh which is so more powerful with its 3.33Ghz quad-core i5, SSDs; it&#8217;s becoming however more likely that in the future I&#8217;ll go back to a single computer, maybe the 15&#8221; Pro connected to the same Eizo 24&#8221; monitor for some comfortable photo editing sessions at home, and possibly the iPad mini as my to-go machine.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The other day I played with my friend&#8217;s Galaxy Note 2; a 5&#8221; hybrid smarthone-tablet , great display and fast and powerful and full of interesting details and though-out applications; it even has a stylus, which looks dorky but for some precision work beats the fat fingers hands down. The problem is that such a device tries too hard to do more things than an iPad, and in doing so it becomes too convoluted; and if a user like me, who scores high on the nerd-scale, finds it &#8220;complicated&#8221; , I can only imagine the frustration that a normal user (mum; grandpa; your older brother who does not really click with technology; etc.) could experience.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>The only viable options at the time of writing are one of the Samsung Galaxy-whatever and Google&#8217;s Nexus 7; right now I am waiting for the delivery of a chinese knock-off which I bought for a ridicolously low price &#8212; if the experiment goes well, I will write something more about it.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>So the 32gb wifi version is the one that I will probably go for. And next year I will surely sweat over the &#8220;iPad mini with Retina display&#8221;.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
