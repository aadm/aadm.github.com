I can be reached via Twitter, [@aadmtwi](http://twitter.com/aadmtwi), [Google+](http://plus.google.com/+AlessandroAmatodelMonte/) or through my [flickr account](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/), where I also collect my  photographs. I used to have a solid instagram feed but then I got bored so [that](http://instagram.com/aadm) is pretty much a dead end.

If you're not on twitter or flickr, you can use [my tumblr ask page](http://aadm-fotografia.tumblr.com/ask) to send me any question or comment. 

Unless otherwise stated all the content appearing here on [aadm.github.io](http://aadm.github.io) is my (Alessandro Amato del Monte) exclusive property. You may share and distribute my work but you cannot modify it, and obviously you cannot make money out of it.

In other words: please do not manipulate or remix my photos, illustrations and content without my consent. You may link to the site and quote selected text but please put a a link back to the original content. Re-publishing of complete posts or articles is not permitted.

If I put here something made by others I will clearly state it and never appropriate somebody else's work. I expect to be treated the same way.

If in doubt, ask me first: we may become friends.

Oh, and thanks for stopping by.
