How can you capture the wind on a photograph? How can you make the viewer feel the cold or the warmth of a place? How can you make landscape photography communicate the sense of a place? Can a photo be a substitute for the simple, raw emotions that one feels when he's out in the woods or in the mountains?

These are the things that lately have been on my mind. I'm pretty sure it all started with something that Andrew Molitor wrote on his [brilliant blog](http://photothunk.blogspot.com/). He keeps bashing on these points and right now I'm not going to search for those two or three posts where he specifically said the things that keep nagging me but here's what I remember:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

* landscape photographs that get millions of views on the internet are mostly about totems that get abused over and over; the silky water effect (tranquil seascapes, fluffy waterfalls), the obscene, over-the-top colors which are nothing like real life.
* the absurdity of somebody shooting basically the same photo in seven different continents, just to preserve his "style".
* the sterility of such photographs, that are incapable of communicating if it was blazing hot that day, how damn hard was to get to that viewpoint, if the photographer was feeling dehydrated, if he got sick as a dog only to take that fucking last photograph at sunset.

Also, I got into this loop probably because I have realized I have lost my interest in street photography (which I honestly thought it was _my_ thing[^nota-street]) and I struggle to give a meaning to my photography. Apart from recording my family life (which is totally fine, and very likely to be the most important thing I can do), what is it that my photographs can do?

I'm trying to see if I'm able to create photographs that communicate one thing only (for now; in the future maybe two or three). Like I said before: if the thing I want to shoot is warm or cold. If *I* was warm or cold when I shot that thing. If it was easy to get that photo or if I had to work hard, physically or mentally.

Consider this my first experiment. I will leave to the reader the task to find out what is it that I wanted to communicate here.

[^nota-street]: Why I am no longer a street photographer (if I have ever been one): because too many people call themselves street photographers; because I don't see the point in having as main subjects of all my photos some random strangers;  because I despise the macho subculture that force wannabe photographers to shoot people right in their faces with some silly excuses to "make connection"; because it is too easy to create emotions relying on some borderline extraordinary character that you meet by simply walking; because I have no time to roam the city streets in search of the elusive street photograph.
