I have kept this yellow notepad for I don't know how long.

It serves the basic purpose of taking notes but it's tough and water resistant too. Real geologists use this kind of notepad when they're out in the field to record events, log rocks, sketch outcrops, maybe draw funny faces too.

I am not a real geologist but I have had the opportunity from time to time to visit interesting places. I thought this notebook would be ideal to collect what I call my _geolandscapes_.
