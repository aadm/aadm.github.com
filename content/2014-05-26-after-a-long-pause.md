This is a short post just to let the readers know that I am ready to be back on track with some brand new content -- and apologies for not being very active these past few months here or on my other channels like [twitter](http://twitter.com/aadmtwi) or [Google+](http://plus.google.com/+AlessandroAmatodelMonte/).

I have been busy with moving to the new house, stay with my family, work and all this sort of things that simply takes your time away; I have to say, some of these things are exhausting mentally (e.g., the moving!), others are quite different, you simply enjoy having your time taken away (and that's why I've put those two photographs of my daughter Valentina).

But I have finally sorted out a few things, and despite being in Turkey at the moment I am able to start again with some new things which I hope will be of interest to someone (if not, no worries, I mainly do this blog for myself).

My ideas are to finally complete and put out in my Projects sections two fairly large collections on San Donato and Milano; to update my progress on my 365 project and talk a little about a Python script I've written to graphically illustrate my progress; to create my personal portfolio -- the paper one I mean, thanks to the fancy inkjet printer I'm getting soon; to tell some other Python stories related to its use in my daily work and finally talk a bit about bikes and photography in general.

Last but not least, I have setup a new Tumblr website just because it's fun and I like the look of it, where I have dumped a few photographs with slightly less editorial curation than my usual. Check it out at [aadm-fotografia.tumblr.com](http://aadm-fotografia.tumblr.com).
