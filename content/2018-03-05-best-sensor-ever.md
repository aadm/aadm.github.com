That's the Nikon D850 I'm referrring to. But it can also mean the Fuji medium format GFX's sensor, or any of the latest Sony full frame mirrorless.

Anyway, the point is that I have a few raw files from a D850, courtesy of my friend Daniele. He rented the camera and the best lenses available (Sigma primes; the 50mm f/1.4 and the 14mm f/1.8).

I started to play with these two shots taken in obvious places in California. I wanted to see for myself if I really need something like a 50 megapixel sensor with huge dynamic range that can see in the dark (yes I know that I am not considering other important aspects like build quality, autofocus, lens availability, but bear with me, I really want to concentrate on the sensor itself and what it can do -- because let's face it, that's the main selling point of all new cameras).

These are the original files, no editing save for a 16:9 crop:

And these are my processed version:

So what I normally do with shots like this -- I make them even tighter in terms of dynamic range; a robust S-shaped curve, so that all the dark goes to deep black. I don't care about sharpness anymore. Noise is truly welcome especially for my family photos that are all shot at minimum 2000 ISO. Do I really need a D850?

For me, the era of being gobsmacked by the qualities of the sensor is truly over. For the kind of photography I pursue; for the kind of processing I do. When I bought my first full frame camera, the Nikon D600, I remember being positively overwhelmed by the sensor -- how easy it was to let the colors I wanted come out of the raw files; the amount of information hidden in the blacks; the possibilities, ah the possibilities!

But then I realized that I was never gonna win a contest. Or have my photos shown in exhibitions. I have never been a patient photographer, never had the time to properly do photography the way it's supposed to be done, i.e. a relentless hunt for photo opportunities, the camera always at hand, wandering across temple-cities like New York or London or Paris doing what Doisneau or Maisel would do. Or living the wilderness like Galen Rowell or Q.T. Luong, waking up at ungodly hours to set up tripods or wait for the perfect light. My kind of photography is stolen from my real life, it's those little interruptions between commuting to work and playing with my daughter, cooking with my wife and riding bikes with friends, nothing's ever planned or thought in advance.


It's true, I do think constantly about photography, and I do spend hours cleaning up my database at home and organizing photos and editing the weed for some projects like photobooks or simply blog posts that will probably never see the end but I just need a modern camera that does its job.

The D850, considering what it does best, considering the price and the size, is not for me.
