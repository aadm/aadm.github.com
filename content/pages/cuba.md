It does seem silly to even call this a "project". I mean, these are photographs I took during a holiday I spent in Cuba with my family. But I suspect that countless other photographic projects by so called "artists" have been taken while on holidays because, let's face it, this isn't the 50s where Life magazine or Epoca would send Cartier-Bresson or Walter Bonatti to some faraway place, asking to please come back with photographs of that place, and while you're there enjoy the life because it's all paid for.

So yes I have a bit of a thing against so many "projects" that I see on the web, masquerading the wonderful but simple act of taking pictures, trying so hard to give some sort of meaning, to make them more serious because artists are seriously serious, and they are very concerned about global warming, poverty or prostitution in the slums.

And Cuba? Don't get me started on Cuba. Millions of photographs have been taken in Cuba (90% of them in Habana, 80% of which they invariably display an older guy or lady smoking a cigar). Do you need to see yet another project on Cuba?

I don't have an answer to that, but have a look around; you may enjoy this set of photographs. And at least I won't pretend that I was in Cuba doing anything else than looking around, enjoying the place with my wife and my daughter, trying to capture an idea of this place which does not necessarily involve old building, cigars, beautiful natives, and american cars from the fifties.
