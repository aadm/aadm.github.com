Title: aadm.github.io has moved!
Save_as: index.html

Hi everyone!

I have moved my website elsewhere, please redirect your browser to:

<http://aadm.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com>

(This is a temporary address, until I come up with a good domain name to register.)

The reason for this move is to get rid of any limit in size for my website and at the same time host all of my photos directly on the website. At this moment, Amazon S3 is the only technology that allows me to do that with minimum hassle due to the native support for static websites like mine.

In the future, I plan on moving all my photos to the new website and then no more social network silliness -- if anyone wants to talk with me, he/she will know how to do so.

So long _aadm.github.io_ and _flickr.com/photos/aadm_ !
