title: About

I have been calling myself aadm on the internet since forever. I have a very long name, and I have always wanted it to be much shorter: that's why aadm.

I like photography and making photographs.

The journal also collects my random writings about all the other things that interest me.

I was born and raised in Southern Italy and have lived in Gravina, Bari, London, Milano; I'm currently based in Stavanger, Norway.
