Summary: Well it seems I have ported my blog to Pelican.

Well it seems I have successfully ported my blog to Pelican.

And yes, there were a few long nights to do that but to be honest it was easier than Jekyll.

For now the site will remain active on this secondary page, [The Liquid Steppe](http://aadm.github.io/the-liquid-steppe).
