Camera reviews should be written either within 1-2 months from initial purchase or after 5 years.

Reason is that after a few weeks any average person would know by heart button locations, how to quickly change the camera settings, know what's the highest ISO and the minimum sustainable shutter speed. And obviously shot a few hundreds photographs in different locations and situations.

After this initial period, you either are still using the camera and enoying it or you've decided to look elsewhere. And if you decide to carry on using the camera, you begin to find loopholes, alternative ways to go around certain defects, until you no longer remember what was the problem you started to circumvene -- and the longer way to accomplish one task becomes the norm. For example: on the Fuji X-Pro 1 it's kind of silly to have two different ways to set the ISO, when recalled by the Fn function; using the wheel when using the optical viewfinder, or the up and down arrows then using the electronic VF. This is plain stupid, but I can already see my muscle memory using either method smoothly with no real impact on my actions.

So this is the moment when you're still excited by the toy, but you go mental thinking about the many things that could be fixed to have an even better experience. And this is also the right moment to tell the others what works, what doesn't, and find an argument to why you see yourself clinging to the toy until the end of times.

The alternative is to take out from the closet the old camera that you haven't touched in years but you still remember the emotions and the decisions that led you to put it aside and get the new toy. But you still have it in the closet, so that means something special was there.

I recently bought a second-hand Fuji X-Pro1 and I believe it's a keeper. These are the reasons:

1. The body, and how it feels in your hand. Surprisingly solid when you shoot, no fear of blurry pics when using slow-ish shutter speeds (1/50th and below). In fact that was one of the issues I had when leaving the effectiveness of the in-body stabilization of my other little camera (Olympus OM-D). It just means that the camera has good damping, like the bigger Nikon that I have.

2. The controls, love the old-school dials but I hate:
  * lack of mechanical ISO control (fixed in the X-Pro2)
  * lack of simultaneous AF-ON button while using the camera in AF mode and possibility to lock exposure with half-press of shutter button.
  * no visual focus acquisition confirmation when using the camera in manual focus mode and using AE/AF-L button to activate focus (the camera beeps, but obviously it will not beep when in silent mode, which is my default).
  * the focus ring on my 35mm f/2 is too fucking long, takes too many turns to go from 0 to infinity.

3. JPEG vs Raw, took me a long time to decide whether to go for the JPEG route which so many people swear by on the net, or follow my usual Raw-based workflow. I was not helped by the stupid way Lightroom treat Raw+JPEG pairs (inability to recognize them as such, i.e. copies of the same  photos, so no automatic propagation of metadata and keywords and no possibility to choose which one was the 'final' version; incidentally, my old favourite application, Apple's Aperture, used to deal with these pairs flawlessly). At the end, after comparing JPEGs with Raw files processed using the Adobe-provided profiles, I discovered that the two things were essentially the same (full disclaimer: I didn't go into the kind of obsessive analysis that weirdos do in dpreview's forum; if the files looked the same at 100% in Lightroom then it's good enough proof for me). So normal Raw-workflow for me. But I must admit to have a profile for a quick, intense, JPEG-only black and whites which had given me a few good shots (and zero time spent fucking around in Lightroom, big PLUS).

4. The above discussion on JPEG vs Raw also ties in with the use of electronic (EVF) vs optical (OVF) viewfinder. I admit that the presence of the OVF was the main reason why I specifically hunted for a used XPro 1 and not an XE-2 or an XT-1. I thought that shooting in-camera black-and-white only JPEGs was best done via EVF, just to train my eye at looking the world in mono. OVF on the other hand was the option to save battery power, not being distracted by the bright or subdued or otherwise different colors (and the occasional OVF lock-up when shooting consecutive frames). Right now, I'm kind in the middle, using the OVF gives me an immediate feedback of focus lock when using the camera in my usual way (manual focus mode with focus activation on the AE/AF-L button) plus setting the film profile to Pro-Neg S and lower contrast/color gives me a bland baseline look similar to the unprocessed RAW.

5. You know the new Leica M-D, the one with no LCD screen which sells for even more crazy money than the one with LCD (among various other things)? Call me crazy but the simplicity of that camera speaks to me in a way that's difficult to put it in words. However, I know myself and never check the back screen after taking a shot. Never. I simply prefer to shoot, and maybe "work the scene", change the composition slightly or the aperture. Using the X-Pro1 with the OVF and the shot review off it's very similar (I would imagine) to the experience of shooting a Leica M-D. You just shoot, then review at home, not bothered by the pretty colors shown in the EVF. Oh and speaking of Leicas: the other model I've lusted over is the M Monochrom (the original one with the CCD sensor); and it's also the only Leica I have actually tried. Again beautiful camera which I would buy in a heartbeat if I had that kind of money. But once again, use the Fuji in Monochrome film simulation with contrast jacked up or lowered down, and you have All of this for a fraction of the price and maybe 90% of the quality (I'd argue it's even more than that, and I'm talking about this old X-Pro1 not even the new one).

 I have been lusting after a Leica camera for a very long time. An
