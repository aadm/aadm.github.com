I just happened to read [Milnor's blog](http://shifter.media/dispatches-joe-buissink/) that featured an interview with some wedding photographer I didn't know -- and i still don't know -- but what was interesting was the little background story Milnor wrote so I thought about something:

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->


* I will never ever shoot a wedding as a paid photographer
* Even if I did, that would be insanely expensive for the lunatic who would hire me
* That I would never ever do the silly setups and fake poses everybody (read above for the meaning of "everybody") does
* but if it was my wedding I would only have me as photographer, because then I would get stuff like this:

Ok, that last point was a bit overselling myself, but you did read that I would never do photography under commission, i.e. money is not and will never be in the frame so to speak. So yes I am overselling myself, but that's because those photographs above are something that I like very much. They were taken at my cousin's weddding a couple of years ago, in some beautiful place in the Roman countryside.
