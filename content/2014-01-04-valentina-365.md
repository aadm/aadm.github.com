These are the days when everybody talks about their new year's resolutions. I mean everybody in the english-speaking world, I don't think that italians do this often -- but this will change (or may already have changed) because we seem to follow, like sheep, everything that americans do.

And I thought I was immune from these habits but here we go: I'm gonna make something this year, something not particularly original, something that countless other amateur photographers have done or are doing right now -- a 365 project: one picture a day, on a specific theme. And the theme (as you can deduce from this post's title) will be my daughter Valentina.

What's important is that it will not be a personal project, in the sense that I will not pursue any artistic growth with this project; the idea is just to create something to leave to my daughter. A day-to-day documentary of this little girl, which I hope will be of some value to her.

Obviously, it will also be of incredible value to me, since I have alread experienced in this first and a half year of her life how fast she grows and I'm just amazed at the changes in her when I look back at photographs dated back one or two months. If it was a proper photographic project I would never be happy with some blurriness or bad framing or whatever else that I pursue when I do photographs for myself. In this way I free myself from this self-imposed constraints, will only shoot jpegs (no messing around in post production with raw files) and be happy with snapping one photo a day at my daughter.

It is also a personal declaration, a "resolution" (not this year's resolution... a resolution for the rest of my life) to avoid abusing my daughter for my own personal projects, as too many photographers have done in the past (see for example [Elinor Carucci](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jan/11/elinor-carucci-children-photography), [Sally Mann](http://sallymann.com/selected-works/family-pictures) and ["the reluctant father"](https://www.lensculture.com/articles/phillip-toledano-the-reluctant-father)).

At the end I would arrange all these 365 photographs in a book, documenting in fifty pages or more this entire year; I would then leave it on a shelf and let time pass until one day Valentina will discover it again, and see how much she's changed during 2014.
