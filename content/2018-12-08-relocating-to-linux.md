Status: draft

These are my notes on a radical move. The first draft was written in August 2017. I edited and completed this post in December 2018.

The radical move is leaving the Apple world for good and moving (back) to Linux.

I already left the iPhone world a few years ago, after getting annoyed by the slowness of my iPhone 4S (back when the 4S was only a couple of years or so outdated). I moved to Android, enjoying the very low price of good devices (first a Motorola Moto G and then a Huawei P9 lite, so nothing too fancy) and not regretting anything about the iPhone/Apple ecosystem. 

And now after having realized how little I use native apps on my Macbook, I want to go back to a simpler/more honest world of computing.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

My computing needs are simple: Lightroom for photography; iMovie to edit home videos; Python for work and scientific investigation/hacking; a friendly, configurable and cross-platform text editor to write code, blog posts, articles and thoughts. My website is entirely on github and I only need Python, git and a text editor to maintain it. I use markdown to write everything, from blog posts to notes and scientific papers.

I also sometimes may need some Excel or Word but Google productivity apps are enough for me (and then there's always Open Office if I don't want to use a browser-based apps; but honestly, browser-based email has been my only email client for ages now and I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything).

Quite simply, I enjoy the pure hacking with unix-based tools like `ffmpeg`, `sed`, `grep` or `graphicsmagick`.

Some additional apps related to my photography that I have used are Hugin (to do panoramas and assembling together multiple photos) and Blurb's Bookwright (to put together photography books).

## status update circa end of 2017

So, which one of these apps are *not* available on Linux?

* Lightroom
* iMovie
* Blurb's Bookwright

In order of increasing complexity/difficulty, this is what I am planning to do:

### assembling photobooks 

Scribus instead of Bookwright.

Mastered the app in a few days, still need to check the output, submit a book to Blurb as pdf and see how it comes out. 

Pros: much more precise than Bookwright; the complexity does not bother me.

Cons: does not have pre-made templates for the kind of publications and formats provided by Blurb.

### editing videos

Tried Blender, Shotcut, Davinci Resolve. After trying Resolve last year I gave up because it did not run smoothly on my macbook. Tried the latest release (v 14.3) again a few days ago and now it runs much better. Also, after the terrible experience of Blender (too complicated, difficult to understand even how to move clips around and do very basic editing in a few nights of study and following youtube tutorials), I find it very easy and user-friendly. And back when I tried it the first time it definteltly did not seem user-friendly to me -- quite the opposite in fact!

I am now using DR for my editing and I'd be happy to continue using that on Linux, but it seems that Linux support is limited and requires specific hi-end hardware (like dedicated audio cards). Without audio you can't really use a video editor so that means that if I were to switch right now, pre-summer 2018, I would have to use something else. But I still hope that Davinci will make the Linux port a litte bit more friendly for enthusiasts and with simpler requirements in the near future.

There is however another solution: Kdenlive. It may be simple enough to pick it up to do basic editing. 

### photography

That's the hardest part. I have Darktable installed and have tried to use it for some time now but the problem is just the tremendous loss of all the edits done in the past.

Having been already once through the experience of moving from one system to another (Aperture to Lightroom) I know very well the amount of work involved just to keep the database intact.

Apart from this, I don't have first-hand knowledge on the application itself, if it is as fast as Lightroom -- and perhaps more importantly, if it feels like it. The "feeling" of being fast also relies on the keyboard shortcuts that you learn almost by accident after years of usage, and that surely could not be translated to a new one.

There is however a primary advantage of all open source software, that is that almost invariably they offer a level of customization that is not present on commercial application.
