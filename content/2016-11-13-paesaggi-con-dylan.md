We leave our houses around the same time on Saturday morning, and we go for a hike. We will be photographing unspectacular views of familiar landscapes, and make them count. We are sick of the pacific massacres of exotic locations and unsuspecting people that are submitted to the main photography outlets around the net. We don't have artsy, flowering text or social messages adorning our frames, but we still think there's merit in that, in the simple desire of framing the world around us. We think that the best photography is found, not created, so we drop all the pretense and become simply hunters.

We are fifteen hundred kilometers away, and at the end of today we will ask each other: what did you see? what did it grab your attention? abstractions? pleasing compositions? pristine or culturale landscapes? do you even pretend there's no human influence on our landscapes? why do you photoshop garbage, power lines, the ugly hut?

One hike will take us to a famous tourist destination in Southern Norway; the other one will be a more subdued walk in the foothills just outside a Northern Italian city.

Same day, different places, a tenous link given by the long friendship that persist between the two authors.
