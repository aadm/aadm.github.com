                <p>I was very happy about <a href="2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html">my hackintosh</a>, everything going smooth and easy&#8230; until it all broke down and I was left with no computer for almost a&nbsp;month. </p>
<p>And what was even stranger was that also Filippo&#8217;s hackintosh, built at the same time as mine, went down only a few days after mine. If computers were organic, I would have thought about some sort of mortal&nbsp;sickness. </p>
<p>Ok let me say that there&#8217;s a happy ending to this story: the motherboards were not dead but only in a coma. It was necessary to reinstall the bios and use an external graphic card to redirect the display because for some reasons the integrated <span class="caps">HD3000</span> gpus were not&nbsp;working.</p>
<h2>details of a hackintosh entering  a&nbsp;coma</h2>
<p>So I built <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html">these two hackintosh</a>, one for me (A) one for a friend&nbsp;(B). </p>
<p>component | hackintosh (A)                | hackintosh (B)             <br />
<span class="caps">CPU</span>       | Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz    | Intel Core i3-2105 3.1Hz <br />
M/board   | Gigabyte <span class="caps">GA</span>-<span class="caps">H61N</span>-<span class="caps">USB3</span>         | Gigabyte <span class="caps">GA</span>-<span class="caps">H61N</span>-<span class="caps">USB3</span>      <br />
ram       | Corsair 2x4Gb <span class="caps">XMS</span>             | Corsair 2x4Gb Value          <br />
hd        | Corsair <span class="caps">SSD</span> <span class="caps">115GB</span>             | Corsair ssd <span class="caps">115GB</span>
case      | Silverstone <span class="caps">SST</span>-<span class="caps">SG05B</span>         | Nilox / Apex <span class="caps">MI</span>-10</p>
<p>As you can see, fairly standard builds following the <a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.it/2011/09/building-sandy-bridge-customac-customac.html">hackmini example by tonymac</a>.</p>
<p>I updated the bios to F7 (h16nusb3.f7 from Gigabyte website), installed Lion 10.7.3 through Unibeast Lion&nbsp;10.7.3.</p>
<p>Hackintosh A was the first one to die (alas, to enter a coma); it worked great for an entire week then one day I switched it on, could hear the fans whirring away, the hard drive starting up, but no output on the screen, so I couldn&#8217;t even get to the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> screen and do something. I had the cpu replaced from amazon.it because I thought that was the only thing that could have failed, but when I tried the new one nothing&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>Then I went to Filippo&#8217;s house (owner of hackintosh B), replaced my motherboard with his, and blam, the hack is alive! So I&#8217;m happy because I know that it&#8217;s the motherboard that doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>And then the next day Filippo calls, the same thing happened to his computer! Stuck on a black screen, the system doesn&#8217;t even load the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>.</p>
<p>Two motherboards, same model, different CPUs but really this should not matter, different cases. No idea about how this could happen. A defective batch of these two motherboards even if they are very common (and recommended to build hackintosh)? My case (a rather expensive Silverstone <span class="caps">SG05</span>) burning something on the&nbsp;board?</p>
<p>I sent my motherboard to the online shop&#8217;s customer service (in the meantime, a month goes by) and rather unexpectedly they said that nothing was broken, that my m/b was running ok, only thing they did was to upgrade the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>.</p>
<p>Wait a second, how did you do that if there&#8217;s no display output whatsoever? &#8220;Oh well we used an external graphic card&#8221;. So that&#8217;s it? I was still a bit skeptical but then I decided to buy an external graphic card; I knew from internet discussions that this should speed up video and photo editing so that was an upgrade that I was willing to do. I went to a local shop this time and bought a whatever-<span class="caps">ATI</span>-5450 with 2Gb of ram for 45 euros (surely faster than the <span class="caps">GPU</span> that Apple puts inside the 2-grand macbook pro I reasoned). And guess what, the customer service guys were right; I could update the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> on Filippo&#8217;s motherboard and that was&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>Yes I had to play a little bit more to have the graphical card working ok on my hackintosh but now it seems like everything&#8217;s running smoothly. I am still afraid to close the case (it&#8217;s still a post-industrial sight my desktop, with all components running and clicking away in the open), but maybe now it&#8217;s so hot here in Milano that I&#8217;ll leave the machine like&nbsp;this. </p>
<p>I just hope Giulia doesn&#8217;t notice it because you know women want to have clean stuff around, especially if this half-assed mechanical monster happens to live in the baby room (another month and a half to go before my yet un-named babygirl comes into the&nbsp;world).</p>
<h2>sidenotes</h2>
<p>When I installed in the <span class="caps">PCI</span>-E slot the graphic card I couldn&#8217;t get any display once <span class="caps">OS</span> X was loaded, so I had to use this switch at&nbsp;boot:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>GraphicsEnabler=No
</pre></div>


<p>Then I installed ATI5000Injector.kext using Kext Wizard. I did other bits too that I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=260567">somewhere</a>  but am not sure about them. Anyway, just in case I need them again: first, find the PCIRootUID of graphic card, by typing in from a terminal&nbsp;window:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ioreg -l | grep -15 &quot;AppleACPIPCI&quot; | grep &quot;_UID&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>What this command does is giving you this <span class="caps">UID</span> number which you have to put into <code>/Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist</code> by adding the following&nbsp;lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>PCIRootUID<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally I also added these other two lines (to have the card identified as a 5400 series instead of a&nbsp;5000):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>AtiConfig<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>Eulemur<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>a magical <span class="caps">QE</span>/<span class="caps">CI</span>&nbsp;world</h2>
<p>Trying to find information to make the graphic card work I stumbled once more on some acronyms that these nerds in the forums use a lot. Let me write those down so I will remember&nbsp;them:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">QE</span> = Quartz Extreme (<a href="http://www.apple.com.../quartzextreme/">http://www.apple.com&#8230;/quartzextreme/</a>)</li>
<li><span class="caps">CI</span> = Core Image (<a href="http://www.apple.com...ures/coreimage/">http://www.apple.com&#8230;ures/coreimage/</a>)</li>
<li><span class="caps">Q2DE</span> = Quartz 2D&nbsp;extreme </li>
</ul>
<p>Other acronyms that are probably worth remembering can be found at <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=2789">http://www.tonymacx86.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=2789</a>.</p>
<p>These are things that make the graphical magic happens in <span class="caps">OS</span> X; sometimes a card will work but with no magic (i.e., no rippling water effects, no transparencies, etc.); and how do you know if the magic is not&nbsp;there?:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Finder menu-bar is transparent, if a water ripple effect appears when you add a desktop widget and if you can zoom in/out on the desktop by holding ctrl while moving the mouse wheel then you have <span class="caps">QE</span>/<span class="caps">CI</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>update to lion&nbsp;10.7.4</h2>
<p>Since everything was working I wanted some more troubles so I updated my system to 10.7.4 using the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1524">Combo package</a>.</p>
<p>Then, not unexpectedly, <span class="caps">OS</span> X crashed on restarting and had to boot from the unibeast <span class="caps">USB</span> disk, selecting to boot from the drive with the newly installed system using these&nbsp;switches:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>-v GeneratPStates=No DropSSDT=Yes
</pre></div>


<p>I then ran Multibeast 4.5.2 using the <a href="http://tonymacx86.blogspot.it/2012/05/dsdt-database-update-gigabyte-h67.html">updated <span class="caps">DSDT</span> for my motherboard</a> and selected these&nbsp;options:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/179731/hackintosh%20multibeast%20update%201.png" /></p>
<p>It all worked out in the end except for the graphic card which was not recognized as a 5400; I edited again the <code>/Extra/org.chameleon.Boot.plist</code> and added the AtiConfig/Eulemur strings (see above) so I reckon the correct way to install this card is just to use the <code>ATI5000Injector.kext</code> and these two lines in the <code>chameleon.Boot.plist</code>.</p>
<h2>final&nbsp;results</h2>
<p>So this is the updated list of components and total price for my&nbsp;hackintosh:</p>
<p>component | details                       | price [€]   | notes<br />
<span class="caps">CPU</span>       | Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz    | 185.25      | amazon.it<br />
M/board   | Gigabyte <span class="caps">GA</span>-<span class="caps">H61N</span>-<span class="caps">USB3</span>         | 78.36       | stele.it<br />
ram       | Corsair 2x4Gb <span class="caps">XMS</span>             | 41.24       | stele.it<br />
hd        | Corsair ssd <span class="caps">115GB</span> <span class="caps">SATAII</span> F115 | 108.50      | stele.it<br />
case      | Silverstone <span class="caps">SST</span>-<span class="caps">SG05B</span> 300W    | 101.30      | stele.it<br />
wifi      | <span class="caps">TP</span>-Link <span class="caps">USB</span> <span class="caps">TL</span>-<span class="caps">WN727N</span>         | 7.66        | stele.it<br />
bluetooth | Belkin Bluetooth <span class="caps">USB</span> adapter  | 8.54        | amazon.it<br />
gpu       | Sapphire Radeon <span class="caps">HD5450</span> <span class="caps">2GB</span>    | 45          | local shop
total     |                               | 575.85&nbsp;|</p>
<p>And this is the new benchmark comparison against other macs (small improvement in 10.7.4 using dedicated <span class="caps">DSDT</span> for the F8 Gigabyte m/b <span class="caps">BIOS</span>):</p>
<p>computer     | geekbench      | xbench <br />
hack-mini    | 9029           | 330
mb air       | 2087           | 117<br />
macmini      | 3744           | 215<br />
mb pro i7    | 9608           |&nbsp;&#8212;  </p>
<p>Xbench ran with no thread test otherwise it would lock up, and geekbench is the 32-bit tryout&nbsp;mode.</p>
