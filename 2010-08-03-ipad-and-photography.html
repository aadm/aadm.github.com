                <p>I am wondering about the next iPad. What is available now is certainly enticing and must be a joy for light computing / intense internet reading. I do have limited budget, however, and think that probably the iPhone 4 is a better way to spend my money. But I look at the iPad and keep thinking that it could be a photographer&#8217;s ideal machine; if only it had a straight usb port to connect a camera (if I travel light, I certainly do care about bringing yet another little piece of&nbsp;plastic).  </p>
<p>The other option could be that Apple is waiting for Canon and Nikon to put wi-fi or bluetooth connection to send the files wirelessly to the iPad. Well that certainly could help (I hate cables), but I don&#8217;t think Apple thinks in terms of being helped by&nbsp;others.  </p>
<p>And that pretty much sums it up for the hardware. Which means that I don&#8217;t expect Apple to put a camera<sup id="fnref:note1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:note1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on the iPad (too bulky, I will never use it for snapshots &#8212; there&#8217;s the iPhone for that); I am not waiting for a faster processor; the form factor and size looks perfect; a higher-resolution screen like the iPhone 4&#8217;s retina display could be nice&nbsp;though.  </p>
<p>About the software now: this is the area where I am expecting great things from Adobe. A light-Lightroom, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waiting for. Or a quicker Aperture from&nbsp;Apple.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the idea of editing photos directly on the iPad. You might argue that editing 12 Mpixel raw photos is not practical on a underpowered machine like the iPad. But here&#8217;s the point: I don&#8217;t want to edit the raws. I want to edit the associated jpegs<sup id="fnref:note2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:note2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And then link all the editing parameters (remember that Lightroom is a non-destructive editing software) to the desktop version where you would actually store all the large&nbsp;raws.  </p>
<p>So: a Lightroom-mobile with a nice user interface that allows me to catalog and edit photos; its internal database is made of the associated jpegs. Some tweaks to have only a certain amount of photos stored on the iPad itself, but still the entire database structure would be available on the iPad and a few taps would mark certain sets to be sync&#8217;d and their jpegs downloaded on the iPad when it&#8217;s connected to the main&nbsp;machine.  </p>
<p>The lower resolution jpegs would be good enough for displaying directly on the iPad, even when it&#8217;s connected to an external projector. They are light enough that working on them would be a breeze even on the iPad. And the editing parameters would be transferred and applied to the large raws on your desktop&nbsp;computer.  </p>

<p>I think this could really work. Is there anybody listening at Adobe&nbsp;?  </p>
<p><strong>Update January 2012</strong>: After a while I did get hold of an iPad, and I had great plans to use it for my photos. I was using Lightroom back in June 2011 and I found this app which seemed like a dream come true: <a href="http://blog.photosmithapp.com/index.php/photosmith-the-grand-tour/">Photosmith</a>. I got in touch with one of the developers, Chris Morse, and he was nice enough to send me an interesting reply. I hope he doesn&#8217;t mind if I quote&nbsp;him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] As for your expectations, let me share this little quote I read once, &#8220;Ahh, the optimism of inexperience. Soon to be crushed by the dismal intrusion of&nbsp;reality.&#8221; </p>
<p>I use that quote (in humor) only because I think I have to lower/crush your expectations&#8230; We don&#8217;t do any kind of image editing [yet].  At this point in time we&#8217;re strictly the things that you can find in <span class="caps">LR</span>&#8217;s Library module. (minus the quick develop&nbsp;stuff).</p>
<p>However, for the rest of the things you imagine, I think we&#8217;re on&nbsp;target.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened next is that I left Lightroom and moved to Aperture, the iPad became a gift to Giulia and so I ended up with no iPad, no Lightroom, and no way to test&nbsp;Photosmith.</p>
<p>At this point, considering the interest that Apple has always shown for photography, I really hope that an Aperture companion app find his way to the Appstore someday. That&#8217;s gonna be a nice excuse for me to get an iPad&nbsp;3.</p>
