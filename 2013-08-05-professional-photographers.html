<p>The story is about Usain Bolt and the snapshots he has taken using a camera borrowed from one of the sports photographers following the Olympics. But this is not about Bolt, it&#8217;s about these &#8216;professional photographers&#8217; that you see in this&nbsp;shot.</p>
<p>Even if some time has passed from the last Olympics, everybody remembers the scene: Bolt runs, Bolt wins, then he goes on to perform the self-celebratory track walk, closely followed by a pack of photographers shooting full-speed their big professional Nikon and Canon&nbsp;rigs.</p>
<p>And this made me wonder: is this the only kind of photography that gets paid? Shooting exactly the same image, featuring the same athlete, shooting at 8 frames per second, no personal touch to be seen anywhere &#8212; except when it&#8217;s the athlete that picks up the camera and takes some&nbsp;snapshots? </p>
<p>Wait, there&#8217;s also wedding photography apparently, but it&#8217;s very often so cheesy that I don&#8217;t really count that as a way to make a living out of photography. And there&#8217;s fashion and product photography, too, but I am completely uninterested in&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the point here that I want to make? Well I&#8217;m still thinking about it but for the moment I wanted to put out my deeply unsettling feelings about photography in general, and more specifically professional photography (i.e., the one that allows you to make a living); about the quality threshold that the non-expert deems acceptable for pictures; about how so often the real artists are those that do photography as a&nbsp;hobby.</p>
<p>I also wanted to say something about internet forums and discussions where the only conversations are about expensive 70-200 f/2.8 and minute details on color fringing; about learning from the same old guys (Adams, Arbus, Capa, Cartier&nbsp;Bresson).</p>
<p>I wanted to point the attention to the uninspiring street photography trend, where anybody that is able to walk down the streets of a big city snapping in the crowd and coats his/her images with some black and white calls himself an artist (see also <a href="http://aadm.github.io/2013-07-25-on-sloppy-street-photographers.html">this other post I wrote</a>).</p>
<p>I wanted to say something about the appalling quality of the photographs that are put out there on some pretty important news hubs like the italian <a href="http://doveviaggi.corriere.it/dove-rcs/home/viaggi/mare/2012/luglio/creta-classifica-spiagge-gratis.html">Corriere</a>. </p>

<p>Which takes me back to the issue of professional photography, and the fact that very recently another local newspaper took some photographs I shot in Parma and put them out on their website without any sort of attribution. What happened is that I sent these small jpegs to the newspaper, specifically saying that I was willing to give them full-res images pending proper attribution<sup id="fnref:nota-attribution"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-attribution" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I didn&#8217;t get any reply, and then I discovered my small jpegs on the website. It&#8217;s kind of hopeless and sad and infuriating at the same time. The reason I didn&#8217;t do anything with this is that I am not making a living out of photography, there wasn&#8217;t much soul in these photographs as they were simply documenting a small event in a small town, but still this&nbsp;is:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>disconcerting</em> for the well-behaved and enthusiast photographer, somebody who wants to actually help a small-city newspaper, allowing them to use for free his work and get the high-res images in return for simple and honest&nbsp;attribution;</li>
<li><em>sad</em> for the state in which these newspapers are run; not even a reply to my email but grab the low-quality jpgs and put them out on the website?&nbsp;really?</li>
<li><em>infuriating</em> to see the poor taste that the curator of these websites have, striving to just slap whatever comes to your desk just to put out some &#8216;news&#8217;; and by extension I assume that the same kind of approach and attitude are shared also by photographers and editors &#8212; so what I&#8217;m saying is: are these &#8216;professionals&#8217; the ones I should&nbsp;envy?</li>
</ol>

<p>And the answer to #3 is &#8220;no&#8221;. I should consider myself fortunate for I work in a rather specialistic environment doing a rather specialistic job. I have no pressure to do something that I would consider dishonest (e.g., stealing other people&#8217;s work). And I am getting paid to do this work, and even if it&#8217;s not a stellar pay, I can still carry on an easy life with no fears of gettind sacked or losing my job. I have the economic means to have a family, a house, and funding all my other interests, and I don&#8217;t owe anything to anyone because I haven&#8217;t been helped by anyone in reaching this&nbsp;position.</p>
<p>Yes, I do feel sometimes constrained and would love to do something more creative 24/7 especially when the time for myself is so little as in this period, so that&#8217;s why sometimes I think about professional&nbsp;photography.</p>
<p>But if that&#8217;s the state of things maybe I&#8217;d rather keep my job and continue exploring photography in the fragments of the day that are left at the&nbsp;end.</p>

<p>I know and respect the code of some professional photographers; photographs used for business or professional reasons should be paid, no exception given. And even if I&#8217;m not a &#8216;pro&#8217;, I would howevere adhere to this code if there was a great editorial group behind the hypothetical use of my images. In this case however, it was more something akin to helping the community (there were kids I took the picture of that were dying to have their happy face published online).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-attribution" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
