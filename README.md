## "This is the data for my blog" as somebody once said

The best definition comes from the creator of this thing (Jekyll), [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/):

> This is the data for my blog. It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

And the explanation for doing this, again from the same guy:

> I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
