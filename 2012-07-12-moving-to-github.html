                <p>If somebody would actually read these posts he&#8217;d start thinking something like &#8220;what a&nbsp;loser&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here I am, a fairly old <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/git">git</a>, waiting for his <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-02-20-five-months-to-go.html">first baby</a>, with too many things to do at work (and off-work), losing precious sleep hours to relocate his blog on&nbsp;GitHub. </p>
<p>And what the hell is GitHub, asks the non-geek. Well, <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> is basically a <span class="caps">VCS</span> (Version Control Systems<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>) that allows programmers and hackers to exchange and host their coding efforts; but it does more than that, such as the possibility to host also personal blogs for&nbsp;free.</p>
<p>Only a nerd would now understand and nod approvingly, thinking &#8220;oh this is&nbsp;classy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Normal people &#8212; don&#8217;t run away; what you should know is that GitHub is a place that not only gives me space to publish my blog, but also run it the way I want thanks to an engine called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>This engine (a &#8220;static blog generator&#8221;) is something that works also on my computer at home. What it means is that I have full control on the looks and the content of my blog; it stays entirely on my computer and every time I change something the differences are uploaded to the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>This allows me to play with it, preview it even if I have no internet; it means that I have all the writing I&#8217;ve done in a simple text format (it&#8217;s actually Markdown, a markup language which is easy to read even with in its raw format &#8212; unlike <span class="caps">HTML</span>), it means that I don&#8217;t rely on a proprietary platform/host (Blogger, Wordpress, Tumblr) that keeps all my data detached from my computer&#8217;s filesystem and gives me only a cumbersome web interface to manipulate what I&#8217;ve&nbsp;written.</p>
<p>And did I mention that it&#8217;s all free? GitHub has infinite space for my site and Jekyll is open&nbsp;source. </p>
<p>So yes, I&#8217;m an old git playing with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>
<h2>the reason&nbsp;behind</h2>
<p>I guess it all started when I wanted to free myself from the &#8220;chains&#8221; of <a href="http://aadm.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://aadm.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>.</p>
<p>I first tried <a href="http://aadm.calepin.co/">calepin.co</a> then <a href="http://scriptogr.am/aadm">scriptogr.am</a>. Both were based on this concept of static site generation (i.e., I guess they are running some sort of Jekyll-like engine&nbsp;underneath).</p>
<p>After a while, I was enjoying the tinkering but wanted something more &#8212; more control of what my blog would look like I think; Calepin didn&#8217;t allow that, scriptogram did but to see the results you always had to go through the internet and what I wanted was a copy of my blog living its life on my computer. So I discovered the possibility to blog like a pro; free hosting on GitHub, a local installation of the static site generation engine (Jekyll), keeping track of endless modifications via this version control&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I started converting all my posts in a format suitable for Jekyll. I was already far ahead in this process since I already did all the heavy work (pulling my stuff from Wordpress and Tumblr, convert their xml &#8212; or whatever format their exporter used &#8212; in Markdown) when <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-01-23-moving-to-calepin.html">I switched to Calepin/scriptogr.am</a>.</p>
<p>What was left was just some more tinkering with the local installation of Jekyll, but the <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">instructions I followed</a> were very well made and I had very few problems (worth reminding that I&#8217;m a 60% nerd myself, so for my brother or computer-challenged people I would still recommend&nbsp;Tumblr). </p>
<h2>you got the&nbsp;look</h2>
<p>I spent <em>far</em> more time customizing the <span class="caps">CSS</span>, i.e. what my blog looks like, but that&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t know <span class="caps">CSS</span>. I started with a minimalist, white on black, all-Helvetica style based on <a href="http://mark.reid.name/">mark-reid&#8217;s theme</a>&nbsp;because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did not want to spend too much time fiddling with <code>#FEFEFE</code> and <code>{ font-size:16px; }</code></li>
<li>I am not <a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest/">a&nbsp;designer</a> </li>
<li>I actually like simple, terse websites such as <a href="http://zerodistraction.com/">Zero&nbsp;Distraction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then only a few days ago I wanted something different, probably inspired by these two photography blogs (which also happen to have very good content): <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/">photo.rwboyer.com</a> and <a href="http://www.gabrielponzanelli.com/blog/">gabrielponzanelli.com</a>. </p>
<p>Looking at these two sites (and countless others) I realized that pure black and pure white is not cool. Shades of grey, they&#8217;re cool. So I aimed at building a not-so-white page floating on a darker background. And while I was at that I also played with fonts a little bit; I kept Optima as the main one, Helvetica for headers and then chose Futura for the title, navigational texts and copyrights. Does it work? For now it does. I have the majority of my readers agreeing with me (it&#8217;s just two friends&nbsp;actually).</p>
<p>I was trying to get the same experience when viewing the blog on Mac and PCs, but <a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-07-17-fonts-on-my-blog.html">this is for another time</a>. How the blog looks is very important to me and to countless other&nbsp;freaks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I think the best looks that I&#8217;ve ever got was this one on my Wordpress&nbsp;blog:</p>
