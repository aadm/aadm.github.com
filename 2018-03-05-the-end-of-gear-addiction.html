                <p>This is it, my final camera. Meaning that for the next foreseeable future I&#8217;m sticking to this camera, no matter what. This decision comes after a year where I have tried many different tools, perhaps driven by the lack of a true photographic project in my mind (and yes, the usual lust for new shiny things that affect all&nbsp;men).</p>


<h2>a confused mixture of camera bodies and&nbsp;lenses</h2>
<p>My Nikon <span class="caps">DSLR</span> and lenses were always there, a mixture of old and new that covered all my needs (85mm and 35mm f/1.8G, an old 50mm f/1.4 <span class="caps">AF</span>, an even older manual focus 28mm f/2.8 and a cheap and light 70-300 f/4.5-5.6G). Together with a first-edition full frame D600, this is a kit that have never failed me, but I was feeling the attraction for lighter, funkier&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p>I first toyed around with the Fuji X-Pro1 because of its looks and the qualities of the sensor that many have described (and which I&#8217;ve tried to synthesize in my late review written last year). At the same time I did not want to let go of my smaller micro four-thirds camera (and its tiny prime lenses), so I bought a pro-body (a second-hand Olympus <span class="caps">EM</span>-1) just to see if there was something that I was missing in the body itself, but mostly because I wanted to satisfy a very basic and childish need for a rugged, professional body. A pro Nikon body was still an expensive proposition even on the second-hand market but this Olympus body was a few hundred&nbsp;euros.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written about the X-Pro1 already. I liked the experience and the results, the <span class="caps">APS</span>-C sensor coupled with the little 35mm f/2 lens giving back wonderful photographs way past its expiry date (I&#8217;m talking about 2011 technology working great in 2017). It was just a tiny bit slow especially for those family moments that make up the bulk of my photography these days; also I liked a lot the concept of the hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder but ultimately I was always using the <span class="caps">EVF</span> (and the X-Pro1 <span class="caps">EVF</span> is functional but not really nice; perhaps the only aspect of the camera which showed its age<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The Olympus micro-four thirds gear was excellent; I cannot say enough good things of the great/little 25mm and 45mm f/1.8 Olympus lenses. Optically they are fantastic, the dimensions a true bonus (together with the even tinier Panasonic 14mm f/2.5 make a complete lens kit that cover all main focal lengths, from 28mm to 90mm). Just for fun, last summer I also bought (again on the second-hand market) another lens, the Olympus 40-150, a plastic zoom lens once again very practical due to its weight and dimensions and good &#8220;enough&#8221; for my purposes. Both Olympus bodies (mark 1 <span class="caps">EM10</span> and <span class="caps">EM1</span>) are also well engineered, very customizable, and have excellent stabilization. What&#8217;s not to like in this system? The little sensor is also very good, you can play with push/pull processing almost like the bigger brother found in the Nikon D600, with perhaps some limitations when it comes to using sensitivities above 1600 <span class="caps">ISO</span> (in terms of noise, poor color reproduction and handling), but not limiting creativity in any way.  The thing I came to dislike in the m43 gear is something difficult to put in words and can be summarized in the &#8220;feeling&#8221; I had with it; I simply could not bear any longer the constant buzz from the internal stabilization, the unmarked dials, the plastic construction of the lenses (something I also dislike in the new Nikon lenses I was using, the &#8220;G&#8221; series), the hollow shutter sound. All these factors did not make me feel &#8220;connected&#8221; to the camera, in the way a proper, old-fashioned mechanical device&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>But again, from an objective standpoint the m43 gear was probably the best for me because of its dimensions, endless customization of the Olympus bodies and because I was mostly happy with the end-results (which I wasn&#8217;t when I first began to use m43; the limitations of the first-generation 12 megapixel sensor were enough that I have never felt any remorse for abandoning my first m43 camera<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>).</p>
<p>So in all this fiddling with cameras I discovered that basically all modern gear was &#8220;good enough&#8221; for me. I could live with the <span class="caps">AF</span> limitations of the Fuji X-Pro1. I could see and appreciate the excellent results that coupling a full-frame sensor with modern lenses like Nikon&#8217;s G primes but I was also happy with the output of the smaller m43 sensor. What I was missing was something else, something more elemental; the pleasure derived from using a tool that has just the right amount of &#8220;engineering&#8221; in it; that resembled (and, most importantly, &#8220;felt like&#8221;) more a classic camera than a small computer; something that featured mechanical controls that disguised the hidden complexity. In other words, I was aiming for the fine line between tactility/mechanical pleasure and practicality/convenience (I&#8217;m not sure if this sentence makes sense so I&#8217;ll probably edit it out next time I re-read&nbsp;this).</p>
<h2>a motorbike&nbsp;analogy</h2>
<p>I love Ducati&#8217;s twin engine, and I still recall the vibrant and simple two-valve 900cc of my first 1997 Monster (not even fuel-injection back then but simple carburettors). I then had a refined version of the same engine in my 2003 Multistrada; capacity enlarged to 1000cc, lots of grunt, fuel-injection, I toured and raced the thing for many years. Then my last upgrade was a 2003 999s; a proper superbike replica, bought for very little money back in 2008. 4-valve, 140 bhps, Ohlins suspensions, it was a&nbsp;beast.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m planning on <a href="http://aadm.github.io/moto-guzzi-v7-it.html">getting back on a motorbike</a> after years of riding mountain bikes. And the new Ducatis are all loaded with electronics: <span class="caps">ABS</span>, traction control, anti-wheeling, etc. All very cool stuff but to me they take away a little of the simple pleasures of careful throttle usage, the ability to read the tarmac etc. I would probably get a Panigale (the twin, not the V4) if I wanted to get back on riding trackdays and Speedweeks. But for road usage, I believe that <span class="caps">ABS</span> is enough in terms of electronic thingies. <span class="caps">ABS</span>, and obviously a human engine like the latest derivation of the two-valve air cooled twin, not the 4-valve beasts with more than 150bhp (I&#8217;m looking at you, ugly Multistrada&nbsp;1260).</p>
<p>Would I like to have the same 1997 Monster that I used to ride back then? No thanks, let me have a less powerful but smoother, reliable, more refined Scrambler Desert Sled&nbsp;please.</p>
<h2>the final&nbsp;camera</h2>
<p>With cameras, it&#8217;s the same. Yes, that one time per year that I use my father-in-law Nikon <span class="caps">FM2</span> I love it; I love loading a roll of Tri-X (or my new favourite, Fuji Acros 100), I love watching the incredulous faces of my nieces after I take a shot when they ask me to show the picture to them,  I love the mechanical shutter sound &#8212; but would I still love that thing if it was my only camera? No, I would vey likely not shoot that much and get bored&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>On the other side, I have tried for a long time the two extremes that are currently available; a solid old-style full-frame Nikon <span class="caps">DSLR</span> with good glass, and a much more tech-laden top-of-the-line micro 4/3 body by Olympus. One is fantastic and cannot get rid of it but honestly, a bit too large and heavy for carrying it around every day even if you&#8217;re not in the proper mood. The other has excellent stabilization, wonderful little files, tiny fixed-focal lenses that deliver excellent results. But this Olympus started to get on my nerves; because m43 is good enough, but for sure the files are somehow inferior to the full-frame Nikon; the constant buzzing from the stabilization gizmos and the hollow shutter sound did not make me feel &#8220;connected&#8221; to the camera, in the way a proper, old-fashioned mechanical device&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>So I choose something that has roughly the dimensions and the shape of the old Nikon <span class="caps">FM2</span>. That has a set of complete and excellent prime lenses (and most importantly, I already have my two most used focal lenghts, i.e. 28 and 50mm). That has lots of knobs and dials and I don&#8217;t need to see the screen to know what&#8217;s the shutter speed and the aperture. That is faster than my old X-Pro1. That does not buzz like internally stabilized bodies that somehow &#8220;break the spell&#8221; (i.e., the illusion of using an entirely mechanical device). That has a large, bright viewfinder as comfortable as the one on my old <span class="caps">SLR</span> (and in many aspects so much better than&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>But first I got rid of everything else. All the Olympus gear; the X-Pro1 body; the newer Nikon lenses (I could not get rid of the old Nikon lenses I have, the manual 28mm and the 50mm <span class="caps">AF</span> and the 18mm manual because they are inherited from my father-in-law; so it made sense also to keep the D600 body which anyway has very little resale value thanks to the internet geniuses that complained of dust on the sensor). I sold all this gear and I had money to spare to get thanks to black friday offers a brand new Fuji <span class="caps">XT2</span> body. After a while I also got a 55-200mm zoom lens from my pal Sandy (he went for the big 50-140 f/2.8) so now I have recreated my classic kit that I&#8217;m very comfortable with. A 28mm to give a sense of place; a 55-200 to to the Jay Meisel and do my street and landscape photography; the 50mm for everything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>I have used it for a couple of months now, and soon I&#8217;ll have a chance to test it more extensively during a trip with my family. I will probably have something more conclusive to say later in the year. But for the moment I am enjoying it a lot. It is everything that I wanted, and perhaps as a testament to a new approach that I have about &#8216;gear&#8217; I am not overly excited by it; it just works, it does not feel slower than my big Nikon <span class="caps">DSLR</span>, and it has become a silent partner, always with me and ready to go. Battery consumption is higher than a <span class="caps">DSLR</span> but I already knew that from my experience with other mirrorless cameras. What&#8217;s good is that third-party batteries are cheap and they are small too, so it&#8217;s not a big deal to just pocket one or two when you&#8217;re out&nbsp;shooting.</p>
