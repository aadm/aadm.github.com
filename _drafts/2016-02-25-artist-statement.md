I would love to see people that take photographs stop calling themselves _artists_ and then [write this junk](http://geandypavon.net/?page_id=764):

>I treasure the power of revelation and completeness that images contain however I know this power is activated only at the threshold of destruction.

> In my opinion the effectiveness of an image is inscribed in its potential as a ruin. I am interested in revealing the conceptual strength of an image by turning it into a ruin. I have found in the classic media of painting as well as analog photography, the most effective way to perpetuate this moment.

> Recently I have developed a series of works in which I use archival photographic material which I wrinkle, cut or fold to be used as a model for my paintings. The subject portrayed in each photograph allows me to travel from one genre to another, such as landscapes or portraits but always conceived from the perspective of a still life painter.

Note that this guy maybe fears that someone would steal his precious words so the text is locked with some web-trick and you cannot copy and paste (you don't need to be Mr Robot to go look at the source HTML and find the text there, perfeclty prone to copy-and-paste).

Look at this other statement:

> My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and multimedia experiences.

> With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Andy Warhol, new tensions are synthesised from both opaque and transparent textures.

>Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships. What starts out as hope soon becomes debased into a manifesto of futility, leaving only a sense of decadence and the inevitability of a new understanding.

>As wavering replicas become distorted through diligent and academic practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the darkness of our world.

Makes you puke this one too, right? Turns out, this is automated junk courtesy of [artybollocks
generator](http://artybollocks.com/#abg_full). It is rather similar to many more of these artist statement you can find online.

You think I made the first one up (I didn't, I also put the link), listen to these other artists saying their thing:

<http://palazzodellaragionefotografia.it/exhibition/italia-inside-out-inside/>

Really, none of this make sense.

And then you get to the actual "art", and things get tricky. Can I quote [Andrew Molitor](http://photothunk.blogspot.no/)? Look at these piece of shit. I mean this one:

Or this one:

But then I stumble in this guy [Hin Chua](http://journal.hinius.net/), I hear him talking at [the LPV show](http://lpvshow.com/episode-3-1-hin-chua/) and he is rather engaging and interesting, and good things are said during the course of the show about his photos -- I mean the guy was even featured on [the NY Times Lens blog](http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/ephemeral-paradise-in-medium-format/?_r=1). So I'm hesitant to call him a fraude and I start questioning me instead.

* [They called me a corporate whore](http://www.hinius.net/they-called-me-a-corporate-whore/)

And this other [Noel Camardo](http://www.noelcamardo.com/Giant/1/caption) too. He also makes me think.
