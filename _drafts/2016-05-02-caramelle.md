This was supposed to be a mid-year update. Or rather, a collection of little things that have happened just to mark the territory, to explicitly say that I haven't been places forgetting this little outlet of mine. I need to constantly remind myself that even not fully formed things, thoughts, photos, have their dignity, so here we go -- a random series of what has happened to me (and around me) lately.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

### a very clever guy thanked me (and I didn't even have to pay him)

Matt, at the end of his April 2016 tutorial on interpolation published on The Leading Edge.

### somebody else liked my photos

Andrew, talking about [the conclusion of his/ours collaboration project](http://photothunk.blogspot.no/2016/04/collaboration-project.html). See also [this post]({filename}2016-03-01-the-molitor-collaboration.md) that I wrote last month.

### learn to jump in Scotland

And getting my racing instinct kicked fair and square by my good friend Phil.

### we're going to Cuba

It's a deserved break from the long sleeves and cold mornings and moody clouds that we have in Norway. Two weeks from now, me and my family will be spending ten days in Cuba, and I personally will try to avoid all the photographic cliches that have flooded my horizons. I will have my Nikon and two fixed lenses (35mm and 85mm) and a special device that will buzz every time I turn my camera to snap an american car straight from the Fifties or the wrinkly old guy or the handsome but very poor youngsters playing in the streets.
