&lt;!-- Modern-day, first-world emigrants who leave their countries with good jobs already waiting for them on the other side have it all easy and it's difficult to establish any sort of narrative that makes your experience worth something compared to the textbook examples of our early-twentieth century grandfathers.

But the smell and the cool breeze of the sea when I get off the plane at Palese airport, the harsh local slang, are universal. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time (around March 2017) I made a point of taking a camera&lt;sup id="fnref:camera"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:camera"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on my walks and photograph what are objectively banal, everyday scenes. After many months locked away, I have looked again at these photos and found them to be true, sincere, little snapshots of Bari and I like them for what they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original idea was to build a short series of interesting, meaningful vignettes of my hometown &amp;#8212; but the plan failed&amp;nbsp;miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably should have done a bit of planning beforehand and not just go around on foot, hopeful that serendipity would help me out like it has done several times&amp;nbsp;already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual shots &amp;#8220;work&amp;#8221; for me when I&amp;#8217;m on holiday in some new place; i find photos just happening before me, they are satisfying from a technical standpoint, and remind me of good, unique places or situations (see &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2017-02-12-pretty-pictures-of-cuba.html"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m in a familiar place like my hometown there is so much that I have to fight, like the boredom of looking at places that I know so well and see them with new eyes. I&amp;#8217;d love to make other people understand why I love my hometown so much despite hating probably 90℅ of everything that&amp;#8217;s in&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I missed so many things: the blinding sun of early March, the squalid but somehow rich urban landscapes from the periphery of the city center, the smell and the cool breeze of the sea when I get off the plane at Palese airport, the harsh local slang, the placid queues of the immigrants near the police station, in stark contrast with the barely contained disdain that every last one of the Bari&amp;#8217;s inhabitants display towards&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: the people, the flaneurs, all impossibly cool, walking with their chin up like they all own the streets, with no sense of awareness for their fundamental stupidity in posing this way because if everyone pretends to be cooler than most than who&amp;#8217;s left to be&amp;nbsp;impressed?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these photos were taken with a Fuji X-Pro1 and one of the two lenses that I have, a 50mm and a 28mm-equivalent. You can read more on the camera &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2017-02-02-late-review-of-the-fuji-x-pro1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I have struggled a lot on the decision of how to best render these images. I made them in color originally but decided to go mostly (not entirely) black and white, which is a bit against my instinct and also the judgement of somebody else that has a natural good taste for imagery. I have made two stacks of 10x15cm prints, one stack is color the other is black and white. I still don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s best.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:camera" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they really that good? As Bill and Jefferey often say &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;on their show&lt;/a&gt;, how hard can it be to take a good photograph of George Clooney or some beautiful&amp;nbsp;model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we refer to Platon, Newton, Leibovitz as some sort of geniuses because they know how to set up lights and get these professionals (whose job is looking good) to look good? Not to mention the make up artists, strobists and whatnot working for&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;portrait&amp;nbsp;photographers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they really that good? As Bill and Jefferey often say &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;on their show&lt;/a&gt;, how hard can it be to take a good photograph of George Clooney or some beautiful&amp;nbsp;model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I think that a good photographer needs to be able to make art with every subject. And I would extend my critique also to those that are on the other side of the spectrum, for example Bruce Gilden and his &amp;#8220;Faces&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; portraits of ugly people (or just people, made ugly on purpose by careful use of unflattering technique and make-up). When you have exceptional subjects, how hard can it be to take good&amp;nbsp;photos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare this to the art of somebody creating vivid, interesting, poetic images out of the normal everyday life or capturing tiny specks of interestingness from a juxtaposition of sand grains over a floating leaf in the small pond or something crazy like that. Isn&amp;#8217;t this the pinnacle of&amp;nbsp;creativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;printing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been almost 3 years since I bought my printer&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;ve learnt is that the images we love to look at on a bright, calibrated, light-emitting monitor are quite different from their printed versions, almost like distant&amp;nbsp;cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating paper copies of your own photographs, having the possibility to refine the output in successive incremental
adjustments, forced me to understand first of all how different the two media are, i.e. screen and paper. And obviously
we all know this in theory &amp;#8212; but believe me, the result is quite different when you actually experience it by&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s also different from getting the prints done for you by somebody else, e.g. in a lab, because no matter how
close you are to the lab or how convenient this is, there is no way that you could really play with tiny adjustments if you&amp;#8217;re subcontracting the printing to somebody else, even if this is a &amp;#8220;master printer&amp;#8221;. Imagine you do only a a few touches of dodging or a slight modification of your curves &amp;#8212; this may well be all you need to get that final good rendition of your original vision, the image you had in mind when you first saw it during the shoot. Doing this with somebody else? Photography is way too subjective for that. Get your own opinion and ideas sorted out&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual process of getting prints done, compare them to what yo see on the screen, is incredibly frustrating but
rewarding at the same time. it&amp;#8217;s frustrating because no matter how good is your calibration procedure you will never see
the same colors; I believe it&amp;#8217;s also because a print, you have to look at it under good ambient lighting conditions, for
example under the good natured, diffused light that comes from a large window during a midsummer afternoon. And your
computer will be invariably in a much dimmer environment because that&amp;#8217;s what happens if you&amp;#8217;re fastidious  and want to
minimize glares and reflections on your&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a while a new sense of realizations kicks in and you understand how the printed photograph and the adjusted
raw file you have it on your monitor are really different objects; and despite your best intentions to optimize time and
economy of the whole business (the myth of a perfectly calibrated workflow that will allow the photographer to spit out
prints exactly similar to the screen) you start to realize that susseeive iterative adjustmts are needed to get what you
want.  And at the end it is quite possible that you end up with two final versions: one for screen use the other for
real life&amp;nbsp;prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense of reward now begins to mount as you realize there&amp;#8217;s also so many different kinds of paper, and how different
the same image looks when printed on matte paper or glossy&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also start to see flaws that I never saw on the screen, probably distracted by the intensity of the colors due to the
transmitted light; I was scrutinizing some of my  alentima candids and realize how much craft there was like if I was
looking at it for the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you really start to finally understand those books, where the subject matter is king and there is no visual
crutch to make the images stand out, to realize how painstaking it is to see a photographer&amp;#8217;s vision getting a smack
down from the intensity of the printed&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what makes a photographer&amp;nbsp;freeze&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months ago I read &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/15/photographs-not-taken-photographer-freeze"&gt;an interesting article found on The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, which was about the photographs &amp;#8220;not taken&amp;#8221;. And I don&amp;#8217;t know how my twisted mind made this connection, but I expanded my thoughts to include the issue of private photos and if it&amp;#8217;s right or wrong to share them with a community largely made by&amp;nbsp;strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have discussed already my &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/pages/365-valentina.html"&gt;365 project&lt;/a&gt; which was about following my little daughter&amp;#8217;s boring/exciting (like Schroedinger&amp;#8217;s cat, it depends on the observer) second year of life. So this was a private project, and sometimes I wondered about whether it was right or wrong to share these photographs&lt;sup id="fnref:sharing"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sharing"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They are all very intimate of course &amp;#8212; which doesn&amp;#8217;t mean naked infant or something but just that these are intimate moments in our family. The way I was doing things. with no other intention than to fill a book that I will give as a present to my daughter when she&amp;#8217;s older, did not stop or slow me down. If I had to take a photograph a day with the intention of showing it in public, I would have been be much more&amp;nbsp;hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is connected, at least in my twisted mind, to the ambivalence that many people have raised between experience and photography; you&amp;#8217;ve all heard the story about going places and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVOID&lt;/span&gt; taking photographs because otherwise you rely on your camera&amp;#8217;s memory instead of yours; or the greater issue of participating in something versus taking photographs of the&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting conversation with an online acquaintance which went on like&amp;nbsp;this::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[J]&lt;/strong&gt; Alessandro, I struggle with whether or not to share my intimate family photos, too. I think about how we might be watering down our private, personal interactions by sharing them with the world. Thanks for the link to The Guardian article. I tend to err on the side of protecting the sacred moments, putting the camera away, and being &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; the moment instead of recording it.&amp;nbsp;﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[A]&lt;/strong&gt;There must be more than just the two of us that put their heart into something and don&amp;#8217;t feel the social pressure to &amp;#8220;share it&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;however.﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[J]&lt;/strong&gt; I think that the move towards publicizing everything is a powerful social force&amp;#8230;but I won&amp;#8217;t cave. ;-) I have hundreds of photos of my kids that will never be on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;. Ever. In fact, I go a step further and keep a lot of my work to myself just because I have an emotional connection to the photo. That might be too stingy of me, I&amp;#8217;m not sure. Have you ever heard of Vivian Maier? She didn&amp;#8217;t feel the need to show her stuff to&amp;nbsp;anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[A]&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I&amp;#8217;ve heard of Vivian Maier (who hasn&amp;#8217;t these days?), and I like her story, the way she was drawn to photography as a thing only for herself, with no desire to share with the world. I would not advocate the same attitude but it&amp;#8217;s important to know that not all photographs need to be instantly shared, and some are better left on its own for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;observational&amp;nbsp;photographer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone asks me, what kind of photographer are you, I don&amp;#8217;t have a good answer right&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a portrait photographer, not a sports or landscape or fashion photographer; I may be mislabelled as a street
photography kind-of-photographer, but I rarely do black and white which is the signature style to be called that, and
more importantly I don&amp;#8217;t go prowling the streets with the intent of photographing&amp;nbsp;strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am is an observational photographer; which may be the most stupid and pleonastic definition I could choose, because what is a photographer if not someone who primarily&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;observes&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that definition rings true to me, vaguely recalling the title of a book that I have in my&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire &amp;#8220;thought&amp;#8221; however sounds so hollow when compared to the much more &lt;a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/2013/06/roadkill/"&gt;interesting and entertaining essay&lt;/a&gt; that my personal blogging hero Egor has made around similar&amp;nbsp;themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sharing"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I ended up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; sharing my project, only a few bits here and there.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sharing" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;artist and&amp;nbsp;dioramas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this japanese &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/hiroshi-sugimoto-at-the-american-museum-of-natural-history.html"&gt;Hiroshi Sugimoto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes photographs to dioramas in the Natural History museum in New York, and his rationale is that two representations of reality (number 1: the diorama; number 2, the camera) they cancel each other so that the result is a &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; image of the past being depicted in the&amp;nbsp;diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Sugimoto writes in [his&amp;nbsp;website](http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/diorama.html:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon first arriving in New York in 1974, I did the tourist thing. Eventually I visited the Natural History Museum, where I made a curious discovery: the stuffed animals positioned before painted backdrops looked utterly fake, yet by taking a quick peek with one eye closed [&amp;#8230;] suddenly they looked very&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what he does is basically takes photos of these dioramas like any other guy that visits the museum. Only, he does it better, because due to his artist&amp;#8217;s status, he&amp;#8217;s allowed to take tripod and assistants and all the time he&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an assistant, Hiroshi Sumiyama, got inside the curtains, dressed head-to-toe in solid black — a cheap Halloween ninja costume that everyone on the team, including Mr. Sugimoto, wore that day to eliminate the possibility of reflection. Holding up a black pole, he energetically waved a placard attached to the top of the pole during the length of the three-and-a-half-minute exposure, to “dodge” down the brightness of the clouds in a way that is usually done in the&amp;nbsp;darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, these diorama crap may be just a divertissement, made it on purpose to have guys like me go mental. Let&amp;#8217;s have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/portfolio.html"&gt;his portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is even worse than the&amp;nbsp;dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how come Mr. Sugimoto can call himself an &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221;? Well, that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many contemporary photographers, Mr. Sugimoto’s work grapples with questions of perception and photography’s claims to&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty clear. While I take pictures of things I see in my daily life, of my family or friends sometimes, the artist asks himself deep (and vague) questions about&amp;#8230; perception, right. And the truth. Maybe even politics and religion. Taking photos of fucking&amp;nbsp;dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;the artist&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see people that take photographs stop calling themselves &lt;em&gt;artists&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://geandypavon.net/?page_id=764"&gt;write this junk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I treasure the power of revelation and completeness that images contain however I know this power is activated only at the threshold of&amp;nbsp;destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the effectiveness of an image is inscribed in its potential as a ruin. I am interested in revealing the conceptual strength of an image by turning it into a ruin. I have found in the classic media of painting as well as analog photography, the most effective way to perpetuate this&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have developed a series of works in which I use archival photographic material which I wrinkle, cut or fold to be used as a model for my paintings. The subject portrayed in each photograph allows me to travel from one genre to another, such as landscapes or portraits but always conceived from the perspective of a still life&amp;nbsp;painter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this guy maybe fears that someone would steal his precious words so the text is locked with some web-trick and you cannot copy and paste (you don&amp;#8217;t need to be Mr Robot to go look at the source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and find the text there, perfeclty prone to&amp;nbsp;copy-and-paste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this other&amp;nbsp;statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and multimedia&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Andy Warhol, new tensions are synthesised from both opaque and transparent&amp;nbsp;textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships. What starts out as hope soon becomes debased into a manifesto of futility, leaving only a sense of decadence and the inevitability of a new&amp;nbsp;understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wavering replicas become distorted through diligent and academic practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the darkness of our&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes you puke this one too, right? Turns out, this is automated junk courtesy of &lt;a href="http://artybollocks.com/#abg_full"&gt;artybollocks
generator&lt;/a&gt;. It is rather similar to many more of these artist statement you can find&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think I made the first one up (I didn&amp;#8217;t, I also put the link), listen to these other artists saying their&amp;nbsp;thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://palazzodellaragionefotografia.it/exhibition/italia-inside-out-inside/"&gt;http://palazzodellaragionefotografia.it/exhibition/italia-inside-out-inside/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, none of this make&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you get to the actual &amp;#8220;art&amp;#8221;, and things get tricky. Can I quote &lt;a href="http://photothunk.blogspot.no/"&gt;Andrew Molitor&lt;/a&gt;? Look at these piece of shit. I mean this&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carolinedouglasphotography.co.uk/colour.html"&gt;http://www.carolinedouglasphotography.co.uk/colour.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uncertainstates.com"&gt;http://www.uncertainstates.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I stumble in this guy &lt;a href="http://journal.hinius.net/"&gt;Hin Chua&lt;/a&gt;, I hear him talking at &lt;a href="http://lpvshow.com/episode-3-1-hin-chua/"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPV&lt;/span&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; and he is rather engaging and interesting, and good things are said during the course of the show about his photos &amp;#8212; I mean the guy was even featured on &lt;a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/ephemeral-paradise-in-medium-format/?_r=1"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times Lens blog&lt;/a&gt;. So I&amp;#8217;m hesitant to call him a fraude and I start questioning me&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hinius.net/after-the-fall/"&gt;After the&amp;nbsp;fall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hinius.net/they-called-me-a-corporate-whore/"&gt;They called me a corporate&amp;nbsp;whore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this other &lt;a href="http://www.noelcamardo.com/Giant/1/caption"&gt;Noel Camardo&lt;/a&gt; too. He also makes me&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;related&amp;nbsp;pieces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Excuses&amp;#8221; is a fine word for what I do; I am assigned a task (or sometimes I go looking for one), and I see this task only as an excuse to solve the problem in a way that I see fit. So if there&amp;#8217;s even a hint of repetition I will go and write a for-loop to do that. If I need to use a dumb-ass software that I don&amp;#8217;t like I will write the dumb-ass piece of code myself&lt;sup id="fnref:dumb-ass-code"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dumb-ass-code"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I work in a rather interesting field even though it is not as glamorous as astrophysics or biotech &amp;#8212; on the contrary it&amp;#8217;s got a bad rep because it is ultimately linked to a dirty business (drilling for oil). But I am so far removed from actual socio-economic implications (and then, I&amp;#8217;m no missionary am I?) that I can just enjoy the intellectual challenge of mixing geology and geophysics. What I do is to basically inject some physics-based quantitative assessment into a rather fuzzy, descriptive science like geology. So you try to be objective but the Earth is so fucking complicated that nobody really knows the truth before drilling a hole in the ground (which it happens, yes, but not that&amp;nbsp;often).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it fascinating to realize that in some way this is another way to (brace yourself, boring pretentious sentence coming up) &amp;#8220;express my creativity&amp;#8221;. Because this is a kind of job that you can do in two ways really: the first way is you do as you&amp;#8217;re told, the second is you do as you&amp;#8217;re told but you give your angle to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which could mean anything, even applying the same old rules but instead of pushing a button and input some default parameters in the commercial software you ditch the commercial software and create your little routine from scratch in&amp;nbsp;Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is reinventing the wheel over and over but endless iterations are good&amp;nbsp;somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
If not for the business (but who really cares about the well being of Evil Corp[^evil-corp]) surely for yourself.
[^evil-corp]: You have seen [Mr Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_(TV_series)), right?
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I only seem to understand stuff when I write it down or code it up; because it is extremely satisfying (in a visceral way) to create my own tools, code equations found in literature and come up with shortcuts to do the work; because I don&amp;#8217;t fall asleep doing some mind-numbingly boring stuff; because it keeps my mind fresh; because at the end of the day it feels like I have accomplished something&lt;sup id="fnref:other-programmers"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:other-programmers"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also fascinating to realize that you can still enjoy your job when you have passed forty. Try telling that to somebody else who is not a highly-paid sportman or something like that, see what&amp;#8217;s his&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been doing this for 7-8 years now, but with Matlab I have always felt restricted in the way I was doing stuff. Since I have switched to Python (and it&amp;#8217;s been a slow switch because I had the obligation of keeping up with the day-to-day job &amp;#8212; I couldn&amp;#8217;t just jump ship and see where things go) I have found motivation and inspiration from &lt;a href="http://www.agilegeoscience.com/blog/"&gt;other like-minded people&lt;/a&gt; and the things they do and talk about&lt;sup id="fnref:corso-stavanger"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:corso-stavanger"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The beauty of scientific Python is that you quickly realize that many of the problems you need to solve (classification; image processing; plotting; finding relations between datasets) are similar across various disciplines, so ideas and tools to better understand your geological problem could come fron anywhere &amp;#8212; molecular biology, image processing or&amp;nbsp;astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I have had a tutorial that shows how to do rock physics on well log data &lt;a href="http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle34040440.1"&gt;published on The Leading Edge&lt;/a&gt; and this article is right now the top most-downloaded paper in the past 12&amp;nbsp;months:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/TLE_most_downloaded_2016-02-11.png" width="600" height="514"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was a bit ironic considering that a legend like Pat Connolly with his famous article on Elastic Impedance sits at number 9 of this list; that teaches me never to throw shit again at those crappy photographers that get published despite doing  mediocre work because that&amp;#8217;s exactly what it is happening&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I felt somehow obliged to give back something to the community, so I also put online &lt;a href="https://github.com/aadm/geophysical_notes/blob/master/seismic_petrophysics.ipynb"&gt;an IPython/Jupyter notebook which goes more in depth than the article&lt;/a&gt;, and after that I started filling my &lt;a href="https://github.com/aadm/geophysical_notes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geophysical Notes&lt;/em&gt; repository on github&lt;/a&gt; with little hacks and more complete workflows as downloadable&amp;nbsp;notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- It's all open access, even though I would love to say that it's because I cannot disclose highly confidential work otherwise my company blah blah blah, but really it's because the things I do are all based on published material. And to be blunt, nothing is ever truly original in the particular branch of geoscience that I'm interested in. --&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:fuck-around"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do some stuff with computers&amp;#8221; basically means to fuck around for the sheer pleasure of it, like cleaning the bike real good. It has become now more socially acceptable since there are examples of smart guys becoming seriously wealthy with apps and web gizmos &amp;#8212; they surely have started from some fuck-around phase, or else if they truly had a plan for world-domination since the start then hats off to their genius.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fuck-around" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:dumb-ass-code"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not good enough to write something like a &amp;#8220;complete&amp;#8221; piece of code even if it is dumb-ass. But everything I write it&amp;#8217;s sort of fictional so don&amp;#8217;t get hung up on words.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:dumb-ass-code" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:other-programmers"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the dire state that I see around me (in the so-called &amp;#8220;corporate world&amp;#8221;) where social pressure dictate that the only way to progress is to become a manager of some sort and handle a budget, I am somehow conforted by reading that very clever and successful people (in the socially accepted sense) think that doing actual work and getting one&amp;#8217;s hand dirty is good: see &lt;a href="(http://lemire.me/blog/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/)"&gt;this post by Daniel Lemire&lt;/a&gt;, and a little gem by Paul Graham: &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/raq.html"&gt;how to avoid turning into a pointy-haired-boss&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAQ&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8220;Rarely Asked Questions&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; brilliant isn&amp;#8217;t it?). Graham, a programmer, painter and venture capitalist (I would love to have something like this engraved on my tombstone), is a recent discovery I made and I have enjoyed a lot one recent essay, &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html"&gt;Life is Short&lt;/a&gt;, which is a rather interesting take on the issue family vs career.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:other-programmers" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:corso-stavanger"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also happened to be around for a course they held in Stavanger in November last year and &lt;a href="http://www.agilegeoscience.com/blog/2015/12/04/coding-kitchen-in-stavanger"&gt;snapped a few photos&lt;/a&gt; for them.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:corso-stavanger" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E la normalità sarebbe quella di parenti e amici che festeggiano i compleanni, cambiano e puliscono i loro ragazzoni trentenni regrediti a un livello&amp;nbsp;pre-infantile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/20141025_AA25367.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Padre e figlia, ottobre 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L&amp;#8217;interpretazione di Cito sarebbe che: le mamme, loro sono anche contente di pulire i pannolini e cambiare i loro ragazzoni, perché è come un riavvicinarsi a quei momenti felici dell&amp;#8217;infanzia in cui il bambino ha un bisogno morboso di loro. I papà invece si allontanano; e il motivo per cui lo fanno è che i papà (tutti quanti eh, nessuno escluso) riversano sui figli idee e aspirazioni mancate e quindi vedono i figli come proseguimento della loro esistenza o realizzatori di sogni mancati. E quando il figlio diventa un vegetale allora se ne disinteressano, e si&amp;nbsp;allontanano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora, io apprezzo e ammiro quei fotografi che costruiscono una narrativa attorno alle loro fotografie; quelli che cercano di espandere il potere di una sequenza di foto opportunamente scelte con la parola scritta (o&amp;nbsp;narrata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma a volte sarebbe meglio che non lo facessero, se poi arrivano a conclusioni rozze come questa, tagliate con l&amp;#8217;accetta, vagamente offensive e irrispettose di una triste condizione in cui è difficile&amp;nbsp;immedesimarsi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cito insomma dà per scontata una motivazione egoistica alla base dell&amp;#8217;esperienza paterna, probabilmente influenzato da come la sua vita si è svolta. Ma poi estende con arroganza questa sua conclusione facendola diventare una verità&amp;nbsp;universale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosse stato un cretino qualsiasi a dire queste cose, ci sarei passato su senza pensarci troppo. E invece è stata questa persona i cui progetti fotografici sono degli esempi di stile, coraggio e sensibilità artistica a quintali; un vero peccato e una mezza&amp;nbsp;delusione.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="photo"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>still finding true gems online</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2014-10-27-still-finding-true-gems-online.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2014-10-27:/2014-10-27-still-finding-true-gems-online.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Months ago &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/103970774611658298842/posts/FFZS29nwkHh"&gt;I asked the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt; community&lt;/a&gt; about their online reading habits.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my idea is that yes, books give you something else, something that takes you away for longer times, requiring a committment to the act of reading and comprehension that is essential if you really want to go deep into a&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the blogs I read are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; useful and fun and clever and insightful; in other words, I love &amp;#8220;my&amp;#8221; bloggers (how bad this word sounds to me now that I spell it out; I&amp;#8217;d love to simply call them &amp;#8220;writers&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; and for a short list of them &lt;a href="#addendum-my-favourite-photography-blogs-circa-2014"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that I have found another one brilliant writer, and I&amp;#8217;m simply astounded he doesn&amp;#8217;t have more recognition or&amp;nbsp;traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joerg Colberg is the man. He maintains and writes this wonderful blog, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;Conscientious Photography Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently he&amp;#8217;s been doing this for 12 years! So there&amp;#8217;s this incredible archive of clever, well written reviews and opinion pieces and everything else on&amp;nbsp;photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just to give you an idea on how brilliant Mr Colberg really is, there is a piece &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/on_process/"&gt;On Process&lt;/a&gt; that people like &lt;a href="http://jefferysaddoris.com/"&gt;Jefferey Saddoris&lt;/a&gt; (one of the two &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosts) would get a kick out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am not gonna do any synopsis since it would be a waste of time &amp;#8212; plus he writes so much better than me. But there is a passage that I liked a&amp;nbsp;lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you’re lugging around an 8x10 camera or that you photographing your computer screen is pretty much irrelevant for the evaluation of your work. Unless, of course, we want to treat photography like a craft. But I don’t think that’s so&amp;nbsp;interesting&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting piece that got me very excited is &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/photography_after_photography"&gt;&amp;#8220;Photography after photography&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, 
because it&amp;#8217;s all about answering the question &amp;#8220;where do we go from here&amp;#8221;? I mean, do we still hang tight to the conventions established by the masters? Is really photography&amp;nbsp;stagnating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so interesting to me even though I may be so boringly classical in my compositions and photography; this piece was (and still is!) like a corkscrew that opened my head and instilled some ideas that I&amp;#8217;d like to go and test them&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a small excerpt (hoping that Mr. Colberg doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;mind):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography has finally arrived at its own existential crisis. I[t is far from being over - no medium is ever over as long as there is just an ounce of creativity left on this planet. [&amp;#8230;] But photography has long been running in a circle. Over the past ten years, it has increasingly become dominated by nostalgia and conservatism. Even the idea that we now need editors or curators to create meaning out of the flood of photographs ultimately is conservative, looking backwards when we could, no we should be looking&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is digital photography that has resulted in the current stasis of the medium. Given the possibilities, it is quite amazing to see how little digital photography has qualitatively changed photography. Quantitatively, oh sure. The number of photographs taken has exploded, especially since there are now cameras in places where there weren’t any&amp;nbsp;before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;addendum: my favourite photography blogs, circa&amp;nbsp;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, my favourite blogs are still largely the same I was reading two years ago &amp;#8212; which is incredible in internet shelf-life terms. It is also reassuring to follow people who are truly passionate in what they do and are not obsessed with today&amp;#8217;s mantra (monetization!) so that years on they still produce vivid and interesting pieces to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is my short photo-related bookmark list (in no particular&amp;nbsp;order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick Laroque, &lt;a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog"&gt;http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog&lt;/a&gt; (love his style and the quirky and sometimes very poetic write ups; also very knowledgeable in all technical&amp;nbsp;aspects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob Boyer, &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com"&gt;http://photo.rwboyer.com&lt;/a&gt; (I like his technical insights, his wonderfully funny rants against fuji, nikon, whatever, and the thing is that I like his blog even if I&amp;#8217;m not really interested in photographing models which is all he does&amp;nbsp;apparently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ming Thein, &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com"&gt;http://blog.mingthein.com&lt;/a&gt; (I would like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; to like his blog, because he&amp;#8217;s too knowledgeable, confident and successful for for my taste, plus he&amp;#8217;s only 28! &amp;#8212; but what he brings to the table is honesty and integrity and an incredibly professional attitude towards maintaing the blog with frequent&amp;nbsp;updates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gregory Simpson, &lt;a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography"&gt;http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography&lt;/a&gt; (he is just the kind of writer that I wish I was, truly doing his stuff with seemingly no care about what the current rend is &amp;#8212; and I love&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Johnston, &lt;a href="http://theonlinephotographer.com"&gt;http://theonlinephotographer.com&lt;/a&gt; (he has probably the most competent community commenting his articles. I dont care too much for his football insights or other stuff like that, but I find a lot of good information in there, just a shame that his blog is so outdated&amp;nbsp;graphically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joerg Colberg, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;http://cphmag.com&lt;/a&gt; (read&amp;nbsp;above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-passive-watching-tv"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to equate the act of  scrolling down one&amp;#8217;s facebook or twitter updates with passively watching tv. I think the first is the modern day&amp;#8217;s equivalent of the latter &amp;#8212; and to be completely honest I have to say that many many times I have induldged in the brainless and compulsive checking of the damned feeds. That is why &lt;a href="2010-08-03-farewell-facebook.html"&gt;I gave up on Facebook years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I will do the same with linkedin soon &amp;#8212; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aadmtwi"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; so far remains the only connection that I have with anything &amp;#8220;social&amp;#8221;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-passive-watching-tv" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrambe le cose hanno un risvolto tragico, scontato nel caso delle fotografie di Muhammed, visto che ci si immagina la probabile fine che potranno fare i ragazzini da lui ritratti, meno scontato ma ugualmente raggelante nel secondo &amp;#8212; Marina infatti è poi morta in un incidente stradale cinque giorni dopo il suo graduation day, conferendo una certa potenza a queste sue ultime&amp;nbsp;parole.&lt;/p&gt;

In mezzo a tutto l&amp;#8217;orrore e la disperazione che viene dal Medio Oriente e di cui sembra che l&amp;#8217;Occidente ami cibarsi, quasi a scacciare via le brutture della vita (vedi ad esempio le &lt;a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2012/12/20/marco-longari-time-picks-2012s-best-photographer-on-the-wires"&gt;foto dell&amp;#8217;italiano Longari&lt;/a&gt;, Muheisen riesce a ritrarre con serenità la naturale bellezza dei bambini pakistani e afghani&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-nerd"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-nerd"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Io ho ritrovato un ovvio richiamo al famoso ritratto di Sharbat Gula di Steve McCurry (la famosa &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text"&gt;Afghan Girl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;), ma apprezzo principalmente il fatto che Muheisen riesca ad affrontare un tema così spinoso come quello dei profughi afghani e i conflitti &amp;#8212; implicitamente alla base di storie così tristi &amp;#8212; con un occhio ben diverso da quello di Longari e altri che hanno invece puntato i loro obiettivi sul sangue, sulla morte, sui bimbi di 10 mesi ammazzati da&amp;nbsp;bombe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muheisen insomma mostra quello che gli ottimisti tra noi vedono come la naturale predisposizione dell&amp;#8217;umanità, cioè alla sopravvivenza, alla ricerca del gioco e del divertimento nelle situazioni più tristi e scabrose (gli altri, i pessimisti, avranno ovviamente la visione opposta e condivideranno di più le foto di sangue e morti ammazzati che vedono invece come la naturale predisposizione&amp;nbsp;dell&amp;#8217;uomo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarà un caso che Muheisen ha 31 anni e Longari quasi&amp;nbsp;50?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2013/12/10/muhammed-muheisen-time-picks-the-best-wire-photographer-of-2013/"&gt;dice del primo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muheisen’s images often capture the innocent cheer and simplicity of his subject’s life, all while managing to evade the countless photographic cliches that such scenes so often present. Born in Jerusalem, Muheisen is no stranger to conflict himself, and his later experiences covering wars in Iraq and Syria have reinforced his commitment to illuminating the lives — and the struggles — of his&amp;nbsp;subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the children of the world share something in common, wherever they are from,” he says. “An image of boys and girls skipping rope: that could happen anywhere in the world. Children are powerless, and I always do my best to let my image be their voice, and let my picture carry their voice to the outside&amp;nbsp;world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sempre &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2012/12/20/marco-longari-time-picks-2012s-best-photographer-on-the-wires/"&gt;nella presentazione di Longari&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 47-year-old Longari recently told &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt; that, from his perspective behind the camera, 2012 was “another year of revolutions, protests, violent acts and sheer madness. [It seems] like humanity has lost its bearings, yet&amp;nbsp;again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a sad scene,” he told &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt;. “All the energy and the expectations of the young people with whom I shared long days and nights in Tahrir Square the year before, all was being hijacked and taken away, lost in political games. It has been difficult to find images that made sense … that were not simple repetitions of what was done a year&amp;nbsp;before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was waiting for casualties to arrive at the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after an air raid,” he told &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt;. “Phone lines with Jerusalem [where his wife and two children live] went dead. It took me some time to compose myself and get back to the routine of doing what I do. But in the faces of the colleagues around me, I recognized what my face must look like every time a bomb or a rocket falls near their families. Photography is compassion — and that scene in Gaza was the most humbling lesson in compassion I’ve experienced in my&amp;nbsp;career.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;#8217;è questa frase che dice Longari&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-longari"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-longari"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, che mi fa pensare. Lui dice che era lì all&amp;#8217;ospedale, ad aspettare i feriti. Poi succede qualche altra cosa, e parla di compassione, ma mi sembra rivelatorio il diverso approccio dei due fotografi che si rispecchia chiarissimo nelle fotografie che poi mostrano. Longari è in un&amp;#8217;ospedale aspettando di ritrarre scene di feriti e sangue e morti ammazzati. Muheisen è invece tra i vicoli degli slums dei rifugiati, a ritrarre come ragazzini con un passato tremendo, un presente incerto e un futuro ignoto ma probabilmente cortissimo, riescano a giocare, divertirsi, guardare la fotocamera &amp;#8212; e quindi noi Occidentali &amp;#8212; dritti negli&amp;nbsp;occhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A che punto si cessa di cercare il buono e il bello nel mondo&lt;/strong&gt; e ci si incaglia sulle brutture e storture della società? Questo me lo chiedo perché io stesso mi accorgo di una mia naturale evoluzione verso un cinismo che non avevo assolutamente a vent&amp;#8217;anni. E quando leggo appunto il saggio di Keegan, sono combattuto tra la condivisione di questa gioia che trasmettono le sue parole e un moto di scherno per questa ragazzina che crede che i suoi pari che l&amp;#8217;hanno protetta dalla solitudine saranno ancora lì ad accudirla, a spronarla, quando dopo 10 anni ci si ritrova nel mondo reale con bollette da pagare, impegni da rispettare, gli sgambetti, o peggio, l&amp;#8217;indifferenza di quelli che chiamavi&amp;nbsp;amici.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non ho risposte a questo, vedo mia figlia crescere e temo un po&amp;#8217; il mio atteggiamento disincantato &amp;#8212; ma spero comunque di trasmettere a mia figlia una voglia di vivere, di sperimentare, di abbracciare il mondo intero, ispirata da storie come quelle di Muhammed Muheisen e Marina&amp;nbsp;Keegan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-nerd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;una nota da nerd che volevo aggiungere sulle foto di Muheisen: mi sembrano incredibilmente moderne e allo stesso tempo desiderose di raggiungere un ideale di classicità che spero mantengano nel tempo. &amp;#8220;Moderne&amp;#8221; perché sfrutta pesantemetne lo sfocato selettivo in qualsiasi condizioni di luce che evidentemente è conseguenza dell&amp;#8217;uso di focali molto luminose e sensori capaci di lavorare ad alti &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; senza degrado della qualità. Mi piacerebbe anche vederle stampate o fare una analisi da pixel-peeper tipo zoom al 100% per studiare micromosso e quanto il piano di fuoco incredibilmetne sottile di un 85/1.2 o 50/1.4 sia centrato sul classico occhio da ritrattista. Sarebbe bello capire anche quanto i moderni fotogiornalisti siano &amp;#8216;preoccupatì della qualità ultima dei loro scatti se poi la maggior parte delle visioni verranno fatte a scala web, dove il sottocampionamento e riduzione di risoluzione impedisce di apprezzare gli eventuali problemi di mosso, errore di focheggiatura, rumore digitale. Altra cosa che apprezzo tantissimo, visto che ultimamente sentivo fin troppo pressante la spinta dei vari social media verso la santificazione dell&amp;#8217;iphone e delle app che imponevano l&amp;#8217;uso di pesanti filtri di post-processing, è la scelta di usare colori &amp;#8216;naturali&amp;#8217; e non troppo forzati.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-nerd" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-longari"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ci tengo a dire che ho preso le foto di Longari come esempio di un certo tipo di fotogiornalismo. Lungi da me l&amp;#8217;idea di denigrare in qualche modo l&amp;#8217;attività di questo fotogiornalista che ha un coraggio, una capacità tecnica e uno stomaco solo da rispettare. Ho preso Longari come esempio proprio perché trovo che le sue foto siano incredibilmente dure ed efficaci, e se emerge da questo mio commento una certa critica negativa nei suoi confronto è solo dovuta al fatto di non condividere personalmente il suo approccio, ma mi inchino di fronte alla sua maestria.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-longari" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been busy with moving to the new house, stay with my family, work and all this sort of things that simply takes your time away; I have to say, some of these things are exhausting mentally (e.g., the moving!), others are quite different, you simply enjoy having your time taken away (and that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;ve put those two photographs of my daughter&amp;nbsp;Valentina).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/20140331_AA16945.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/20140331_AA16947.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have finally sorted out a few things, and despite being in Turkey at the moment I am able to start again with some new things which I hope will be of interest to someone (if not, no worries, I mainly do this blog for&amp;nbsp;myself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/20140526_AA19110.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideas are to finally complete and put out in my Projects sections two fairly large collections on San Donato and Milano; to update my progress on my 365 project and talk a little about a Python script I&amp;#8217;ve written to graphically illustrate my progress; to create my personal portfolio &amp;#8212; the paper one I mean, thanks to the fancy inkjet printer I&amp;#8217;m getting soon; to tell some other Python stories related to its use in my daily work and finally talk a bit about bikes and photography in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I have setup a new Tumblr website just because it&amp;#8217;s fun and I like the look of it, where I have dumped a few photographs with slightly less editorial curation than my usual.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernandez makes a valid point - the image shouldn&amp;#8217;t be defined by the camera﻿ it&amp;#8217;s captured with. It&amp;#8217;s a shame he had to spend five minutes saying what he could easily have said in five seconds. I turned off after that - couldn&amp;#8217;t take the pretentiousness of his language any&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this comment more than I agree with Hernandez. He created a cool video (was it all his merit though? I see a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; logo on the corner, and no credits for music, editing etc.), he said some interesting things but it was all ruined by his boring and pompous delivery. I also wanted the video to be at least six minutes&amp;nbsp;shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have something against these video &amp;#8220;essays&amp;#8221;; they are very effective and I appreciate the clever editing that makes this jumble of words and illustrations and short clips flow like if it somehow makes&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to me, it doesn&amp;#8217;t. There is not much logical connection between a thought and the next.  If this was a written piece I am pretty sure it couldn&amp;#8217;t stand on its feet. I had the impression of listening to fake poetry, where words are put one after the other just because they sound&amp;nbsp;good..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what do I know, I have never been able to understand&amp;nbsp;poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;sidenotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I should really go back and check some of the work that Koci Hernandez has put online. He&amp;#8217;s incredibily productive, he&amp;#8217;s frickin&amp;#8217; famous too (Emmy award winning, Pulitzer Prize nominee, assistant professor at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley), and I hate to admit that I like some of his work (but he&amp;#8217;s definetely too frickin&amp;#8217; successfull for my&amp;nbsp;taste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a few places that I need to (re)visit soon &amp;#8212; and which I&amp;#8217;d recommend to visit if you&amp;#8217;re intrigued with the&amp;nbsp;guy:&lt;/p&gt;

So far, this has been the best review of a camera that I&amp;#8217;ve ever read. And it has been that review that inspired me to abandon (although only temporarily) DSLRs and got myself that little micro 4/3 jewel that was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-gf1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-gf1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- He moved on to become something like a celebrity in the accultured borough of the web; he is an opinion maker now, and he's reached that higher level where he does not discuss common things anymore or stimulate my lowly interests, and what he does (seems to me at least) is pontificating on various subjects. And I have began to dislike his pieces, because they sound pompous and self-important.
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in recent times he has become something like a small internet celebrity and he is very active in discussing stuff like the future of publishing and all sort of nerdy-techie-creative endeavors that appeal to the smart kids of the interweb. He has reached that higher level where the most appropriate way of expressing himself is to&amp;nbsp;pontificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s recently written a piece on photography (on the New Yorker!) that has been &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/11/mod-cameras"&gt;reblogged by all technophiles and other internet hotshots like John Gruber&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/12/goodbye-cameras.html"&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/12/goodbye-cameras.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and read the piece. It is a very good read, there&amp;#8217;s a bit of history of photographic equipment that people my age can easily relate to, but the conclusions he reaches do not resonate with me &amp;#8212; at&amp;nbsp;all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tell me if the power of photography can really be reduced and diminished by the lack of diffusion on social networks; you tell me if photographs and photography are really improved somehow by the fact that you share them with other&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography to me is such an individual pursuit that the fact that other people may or may not like what you make is largely irrelevant; what&amp;#8217;s particularly fascinating to me (bear with me for a second, &amp;#8216;cause I&amp;#8217;m going on a tangent here) is that photography allows people that have no physical talents &amp;#8212; like the ability to draw and paint for example &amp;#8212; to express their creativity. Nothing to do with peer&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this seems to be his main point, together with his belief that somehow photographs will evolve to incorporate other pieces of information like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; coordinates and weather&amp;nbsp;(?):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that the transition from film to digital is now taken for granted, the shift from cameras to networked devices with lenses should be obvious. While we’ve long obsessed over the size of the film and image sensors, today we mainly view photos on networked screens—often tiny ones, regardless of how the image was captured—and networked photography provides access to forms of data that go beyond pixels. This information, like location, weather, or even radiation levels, can transform an otherwise innocuous photo of an empty field near Fukushima into an entirely different object. If you begin considering emerging self-metrics that measure, for example, your routes through cities, fitness level, social status, and state of mind (think Foursquare, Nike+, Facebook, and Twitter), you realize that there is a compelling universe of information waiting to be pinned to the back of each image. Once you start thinking of a photograph in those holistic terms, the data quality of stand-alone cameras, no matter how vast their bounty of pixels, seems strangely impoverished. They no longer capture the whole picture.
[&amp;#8230;]
Today, it turns out, it’s whatever can’t be networked that becomes less&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So photographs without latitude and longitude or &amp;#8220;radiation levels&amp;#8221; will be meaningless? I  agree that &lt;em&gt;documentary&lt;/em&gt; photography could be affected by this; but when I say &amp;#8216;documentary photography&amp;#8217; I certainly don&amp;#8217;t mean  photos taken by war photographers but the sterile images that you take of your car after a crash to get the insurance&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
A parte che uno che non vede la differenza tra le foto scattate con un iphone e quelle fatte con una macchina seria, mi fa dubitare sulle sue capacita' di giudizio; cioe' chiaro che se te le guardi su un telefonino lo so benissimo che e' difficile apprezzare le qualita' di una foto scattate con una D800, ma e' lo schermo del telefonino il mezzo principale per gustarsi certe cose? Non credo che un regista tipo Scorsese o Coppola facciano i loro film con l'idea che poi questi film vengano visti sugli schermini da 5".
 --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he talks about this&amp;nbsp;hike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of that walk was the ability to immediately share with family and friends the images as they were captured in the mountains [&amp;#8230;]
I saw more and shot more, and returned from the forest with a record of both the small details—light and texture and snippets of life—and the conversations that floated around them on my social&amp;nbsp;networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really go on a 6-days hike constantly texting and messaging and facebooking with other people instead of concentrating on the here and now? Are you really saying that in order to find satisfaction and pleasure you need to pull other people in the whatever you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh man I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a more depressing thought this grey monday morning. When I&amp;#8217;m in the mountains for any of the things I like to do like hiking or cycling or simply making photographs I enjoy the moments, and more often than not, I take a pause and breathe in the fresh air and pause to look at the distant urban lights and just absorb all the smell and the sounds of the&amp;nbsp;woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing that moment with your &amp;#8220;network&amp;#8221; of people, how and why the fuck would you do that? With an iPhone photograph? And why exactly you want to do that, to generate meaningless exchanges of &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;beautiful shot&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;wish I were&amp;nbsp;here&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that today, &amp;#8220;thanks&amp;#8221; to mobile computing, we have a serious problem of staying focused while we work, play, eat,&amp;nbsp;talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we walk and run with stupid white earphones plugged into earphones, so we are not aware of the small rabbit that just happened to zip past by&amp;nbsp;us;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we drive our cars constantly talking over the phone or texting or checking our facebook status, without being aware of the danger we put ourselves into &amp;#8212; or that damn biker that is fighting for survival in the&amp;nbsp;traffic;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we study while listening to&amp;nbsp;music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally switch off all technology and go for a hike in the mountains, do we really need to take a stupid snapshot of some woods and broadcast to a bunch of random people? Why can&amp;#8217;t we stay with our thoughts, or even better, walk with no thoughts at all, just relax, take it all in, focus on the physical activity and let everything else fade&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he also mentions editing (as in processing and modification of an image, not in the purest, photographically speaking, sense of selecting your best&amp;nbsp;shot):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to love using the smartphone as an editing surface; touch is perfect for photo manipulation. There’s a tactility that is lost when you edit with a mouse on a desktop computer. Perhaps touch feels natural because it’s a return to the chemical-filled days of manually poking and massaging liquid and paper to form an image I had seen in my&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that if you prefer to manipulate your photos on a small screen you&amp;#8217;re not really that interested in the&amp;nbsp;quality.&lt;/p&gt;

Two years later, after moving back to DSLRs, I posted &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;a sort of review of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-gf1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was dead easy to open the garage for these gentlemen. Not only did they steal my two most precious bikes, leaving the city bikes untouched, but also my tire pump and all of my tools like allen keys and sockets etc. These gentlemen, they were really into bikes and knew their stuff pretty well. I hope they won&amp;#8217;t be so stupid to go ride my bikes in Finale&amp;nbsp;Ligure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that has left a huge hole in my life. Yes, they were only bikes, but bikes for a biker are very personal things; probably because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to change parts and make them better or different as your ability increases or your interests with regards to terrain or type of riding evolves. So they grow with you, and you start to feel an affection for them &amp;#8212; which I have never experienced with my&amp;nbsp;motorbikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Apologies for the selfie, but that one in the background is my Covert, and this is its last image I have.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these two particular bikes have been very dear to me; I have been riding the Covert since early 2010, and I raced it at Trans-Provence when it was still a somewhat obscure adventure. Let me add one thing about Trans-Provence (I have a long report still in my drafts folder which I&amp;#8217;m unable to complete); admittedly I wasn&amp;#8217;t up to the task, and this event nearly destroyed my enthusiasm and willingness to go out and ride. But I came back home with a more realistic idea of who I was and what I could do &amp;#8212; and I&amp;#8217;m not only speaking in terms of riding ability&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/TP_IK-238.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;With my Covert at Trans-Provence 2010.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I continued to race for fun, knowing full well that I was never, and never could be, a good rider. My placement in the few enduro races I did after Trans-Provence has always been in the lower half of the rankings &amp;#8212; but you know what? In reaching my forties I did make peace with the fact that I&amp;#8217;ve got no talent, only a strong desire to make myself better at stuff that gives me pure and unadulterated pleasure such as riding technical trails and go downhill as fast and clean as I&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;custom 29er &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSDB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src="/images/20130512_AA04199.NEF.jpg"&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Custom-built, fully rigid 29er on the Tartufobike trail, Calestano (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 29er was supposed to be a bike that should have really grow old with me. It was a custom made frame built with love (so they say) by my friends at &lt;a href="http://www.lastazionedellebiciclette.com"&gt;La Stazione delle Biciclette&lt;/a&gt;. Its geometry was stolen (i.e., inspired and then slightly modified) from the &lt;a href="http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/category/bikes/mountain-bikes/hardtail/product/review-genesis-bikes-fortitude-race-12-46745/"&gt;Genesis Fortitude&lt;/a&gt;. All steel obviously, with a rigid carbon fork and some other parts taken from the bin or bought for little money. My idea was to use it as a winter training bike, and then in the future convert it to slick tires and maybe some drop bars to commute, travel, or transport my kid&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was bloody good fun for some serious mountain biking, requiring full committment, a very active riding style and accurate line selection. I had a dream to race the 24h in Finale with this bike; in this past year I did the famous loop in Finale several times and the bike was perfect on these trails. Like &lt;a href="articolo pinkbike"&gt;somebody else has written&lt;/a&gt;, a lesser bike requires you to increase your skills and ability, and a tame, well known trail becomes again something to&amp;nbsp;conquer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/70141449" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/70141449"&gt;29-zero-s-s&lt;/a&gt;, a self-filmed experiment I did months ago, never shared because I always wanted to go back and make it&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bad mood I was after discovering what happened in that garage, I found some relief in thinking back at the previous two weeks, when by pure chance (as I haven&amp;#8217;t been riding much these past few months) I had the opportunity of doing two rides with both bikes &amp;#8212; and these rides, although short, they were absolutely brilliant, reigniting in me the passion for mountain&amp;nbsp;biking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;new&amp;nbsp;bike&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where I am now? Well it seems that I have bought myself a new bike, a do-it-all bike &amp;#8212; which I don&amp;#8217;t have it yet because it&amp;#8217;s in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; now (in the capable hands of my friend Phil that has recommended it, found it, and fetched&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s interesting is that this bike belongs to a category of bikes that I have never ever considered before, because they are all invariably ugly bikes, and most importantly, they are even uglier when a relatively &amp;#8216;small&amp;#8217;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-small"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-small"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; person rides&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I could not find another bike for a cheaper price right now, and because of all the expenses we&amp;#8217;re going through as a family with the house renovation it really did not make economic sense to spend more than 2k euros. So this bike will be even cheaper than that, with a top-notch build&amp;nbsp;nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s interesting is that only yesterday I fond out about these new Kona Process, which come in 3 different models &amp;#8212; 111, 134 and 153 (the number indicates the amount of travel; no indication on wheel size as you may notice). And the one I like the most is this short travel model, the 111, which &lt;em&gt;incidentally&lt;/em&gt; is a&amp;nbsp;29er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Kona-Process-111-DL-Review-2013.html"&gt;http://www.pinkbike.com/news/Kona-Process-111-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL&lt;/span&gt;-Review-2013.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say in this review &amp;#8212; and they were very good in pointing this out &amp;#8212; the matter of wheel size becomes almost irrelevant when a bike is this good to ride. It is also the first time probably that a 29er looks this&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my new bike is a Norco Shinobi, and it is very similar, at least in principle, to this Kona 111. Yes, a bit longer travel (140/120 mm front rear against 120/111 mm for the Kona) but the idea is the same. So now I&amp;#8217;m excited to see what a short travel bike can do. And yes, I&amp;#8217;ll stop saying &amp;#8220;ugly 29er&amp;#8221;. I want to get back on the bike real bad&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-garage"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This garage is the one we have now as we stay in this rented apartment until our new apartment is being renovated. We’ve been here since last October and probably we’ll stay until February. Yes, renovation (as intended in my wife’s plans) takes a long time.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-garage" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-small"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have ever thought myself as &amp;#8216;small&amp;#8217;, but rather normal. 172 centimetres, where I come from, is the perfect size to ride motorcycles, to drive a Mini or an (old) Fiat Cinquecento. It&amp;#8217;s only after the globalization that now Southern Italians have come in contact with these people from America or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; or Friuli where they are all taller than that and start questioning the manliness inside a 172 cm body.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-small" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwen Stacy asks Peter Parker if he likes branzino: you know, “Like, the fish?”.&lt;br&gt;
Then she invites him to dinner, where everyone is saying “branzino”: Denis Leary (playing Gwen’s dad), Peter, Gwen again. We see a full branzino at the dinner table, neatly plated.&lt;br&gt;
Why branzino? The film never says — it just offers up this delightful serving of unexpected&amp;nbsp;weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments, a guy who does not forget to specify his title&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branzino is a New England cold water fish that is usually thrown out, but many restaurants and people interested in ecology believe its use may be a viable way to help reduce the destruction to cod, flounder and other more popular North Atlantic fish whose numbers [and size] are dwindling. There is a belief this will also be a long term benefit to the smaller family fishing economy in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;N.E.&lt;/span&gt; It was in all probability an ecology statement&amp;#8230;.and Dennis Leary is a true New&amp;nbsp;Englander.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for avoiding internet anonimity because it causes all sort of animal behaviour (see any internet forum debating politics or canon vs nikon merits or iphone vs&amp;nbsp;android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to specify to the world that you are a friggin Ph.D like if it gives more credit to your ideas, this I cannot&amp;nbsp;stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this so often in work emails &amp;#8212; and that&amp;#8217;s bad enough, but if you use it also when commenting some innocuous sentence about branzino (which is by the way not New England specific as I have been raised with branzino or spigola, and I&amp;#8217;m from Bari, Puglia) then you just sound like a pretentious&amp;nbsp;dick.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="notes"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>professional photographers</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2013-08-05-professional-photographers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-08-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2013-08-05:/2013-08-05-professional-photographers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Start&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is about Usain Bolt and the snapshots he has taken using a camera borrowed from one of the sports photographers following the Olympics. But this is not about Bolt, it&amp;#8217;s about these &amp;#8216;professional photographers&amp;#8217; that you see in this&amp;nbsp;shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is about Usain Bolt and the snapshots he has taken using a camera borrowed from one of the sports photographers following the Olympics. But this is not about Bolt, it&amp;#8217;s about these &amp;#8216;professional photographers&amp;#8217; that you see in this&amp;nbsp;shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if some time has passed from the last Olympics, everybody remembers the scene: Bolt runs, Bolt wins, then he goes on to perform the self-celebratory track walk, closely followed by a pack of photographers shooting full-speed their big professional Nikon and Canon&amp;nbsp;rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this made me wonder: is this the only kind of photography that gets paid? Shooting exactly the same image, featuring the same athlete, shooting at 8 frames per second, no personal touch to be seen anywhere &amp;#8212; except when it&amp;#8217;s the athlete that picks up the camera and takes some&amp;nbsp;snapshots? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, there&amp;#8217;s also wedding photography apparently, but it&amp;#8217;s very often so cheesy that I don&amp;#8217;t really count that as a way to make a living out of photography. And there&amp;#8217;s fashion and product photography, too, but I am completely uninterested in&amp;nbsp;those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the point here that I want to make? Well I&amp;#8217;m still thinking about it but for the moment I wanted to put out my deeply unsettling feelings about photography in general, and more specifically professional photography (i.e., the one that allows you to make a living); about the quality threshold that the non-expert deems acceptable for pictures; about how so often the real artists are those that do photography as a&amp;nbsp;hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to say something about internet forums and discussions where the only conversations are about expensive 70-200 f/2.8 and minute details on color fringing; about learning from the same old guys (Adams, Arbus, Capa, Cartier&amp;nbsp;Bresson).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to point the attention to the uninspiring street photography trend, where anybody that is able to walk down the streets of a big city snapping in the crowd and coats his/her images with some black and white calls himself an artist (see also &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2013-07-25-on-sloppy-street-photographers.html"&gt;this other post I wrote&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to say something about the appalling quality of the photographs that are put out there on some pretty important news hubs like the italian &lt;a href="http://doveviaggi.corriere.it/dove-rcs/home/viaggi/mare/2012/luglio/creta-classifica-spiagge-gratis.html"&gt;Corriere&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/8939834951/" title="_D6F5050 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/8939834951_1612dd125e_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="_D6F5050"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which takes me back to the issue of professional photography, and the fact that very recently another local newspaper took some photographs I shot in Parma and put them out on their website without any sort of attribution. What happened is that I sent these small jpegs to the newspaper, specifically saying that I was willing to give them full-res images pending proper attribution&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-attribution"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t get any reply, and then I discovered my small jpegs on the website. It&amp;#8217;s kind of hopeless and sad and infuriating at the same time. The reason I didn&amp;#8217;t do anything with this is that I am not making a living out of photography, there wasn&amp;#8217;t much soul in these photographs as they were simply documenting a small event in a small town, but still this&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;disconcerting&lt;/em&gt; for the well-behaved and enthusiast photographer, somebody who wants to actually help a small-city newspaper, allowing them to use for free his work and get the high-res images in return for simple and honest&amp;nbsp;attribution;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;sad&lt;/em&gt; for the state in which these newspapers are run; not even a reply to my email but grab the low-quality jpgs and put them out on the website?&amp;nbsp;really?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;infuriating&lt;/em&gt; to see the poor taste that the curator of these websites have, striving to just slap whatever comes to your desk just to put out some &amp;#8216;news&amp;#8217;; and by extension I assume that the same kind of approach and attitude are shared also by photographers and editors &amp;#8212; so what I&amp;#8217;m saying is: are these &amp;#8216;professionals&amp;#8217; the ones I should&amp;nbsp;envy?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the answer to #3 is &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;. I should consider myself fortunate for I work in a rather specialistic environment doing a rather specialistic job. I have no pressure to do something that I would consider dishonest (e.g., stealing other people&amp;#8217;s work). And I am getting paid to do this work, and even if it&amp;#8217;s not a stellar pay, I can still carry on an easy life with no fears of gettind sacked or losing my job. I have the economic means to have a family, a house, and funding all my other interests, and I don&amp;#8217;t owe anything to anyone because I haven&amp;#8217;t been helped by anyone in reaching this&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I do feel sometimes constrained and would love to do something more creative 24/7 especially when the time for myself is so little as in this period, so that&amp;#8217;s why sometimes I think about professional&amp;nbsp;photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that&amp;#8217;s the state of things maybe I&amp;#8217;d rather keep my job and continue exploring photography in the fragments of the day that are left at the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know and respect the code of some professional photographers; photographs used for business or professional reasons should be paid, no exception given. And even if I&amp;#8217;m not a &amp;#8216;pro&amp;#8217;, I would howevere adhere to this code if there was a great editorial group behind the hypothetical use of my images. In this case however, it was more something akin to helping the community (there were kids I took the picture of that were dying to have their happy face published online).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-attribution" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, these trivial shots of everyday life covered with fine-art pretensions given by a bland conversion to black and white &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s really&amp;nbsp;unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking right now at &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.com"&gt;35mm Street&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very good example of this trend (for other similar examples just visit the countless examples of similar stuff on various Google+ groups or other similar&amp;nbsp;venues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, I should not rail so much against Derek Clark, who must surely be an intelligent human being and he&amp;#8217;s certainly a good photographer (who the fuck I am by the way? Can I judge other&amp;#8217;s work? Or better, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; I judge?&amp;#8230; even if I&amp;#8217;m not in anybody&amp;#8217;s circle?). Anyway, nothing personal against Derek; at least he does not pretend to be a master teacher like &lt;a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/"&gt;that kid that calls himself &amp;#8220;International Street Photographer&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But man, this &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.com"&gt;35mm Street&lt;/a&gt;! What I see are plain, boring, uninteresting pictures taken with no other intention than to grab a boring, plain moment in life of somebody else (the fact that these most recent shots I&amp;#8217;m looking at are from an exotic place like Hong Kong does not make them interesting &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see too many pictures of people watching intently their mobile phones, which is so cliché  that I would rather see that other magnificent cliché of the homeless&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see shots stolen within the crowd featuring nobodies doing nothing&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see unsharp, barely focused pictures and too many references to the hipster camera that was used to grab the&amp;nbsp;shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see captions that look like they are written by a 15 years old willing to show off how clever he is (&amp;#8220;These next two photos show how you stand your ground, even when spotted by your subject. You can see that in the first photo, I’m busted. I took the shot then kept the camera to my eye. She turned round to see what I was shooting, then goes back to her phone convinced it wasn’t her. Click&amp;#8221;). And &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/35mmstreet-com-dscf5123-edit.jpg"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/35mmstreet-com-dscf5124-edit.jpg"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;#8217;s talking about are not even that good &amp;#8212; once again, they are snaps of a lady watching intently her&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#8217;t want to be too harsh. &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.com/2013/07/10/wan-chai-market-hong-kong-part-1/"&gt;Judge&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.com/2013/07/08/hong-kong-streets/"&gt;yourself&lt;/a&gt;. He surely loves &lt;a href="http://35mmstreet.com/2013/06/27/glasgow-edinburgh-london-hong-kong-macao-philippines/"&gt;his work&lt;/a&gt;. Good for&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let me post here some photographs I&amp;#8217;ve taken recently. They were all taken in the streets. Quick portraits of total strangers. No black and white (I am &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not an&amp;nbsp;artist). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just tell me if there&amp;#8217;s one picture of an homeless guy. Or somebody curved over his phone. Or some confuse mass of people where it is left to the viewer to decide what&amp;#8217;s the fucking point of the&amp;nbsp;photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may like them. You may not. Whatever. Just please don&amp;#8217;t label them as street&amp;nbsp;photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;diffidate delle buone intenzioni diffuse sui blog di quegli &lt;a href="http://www.californiabakery.it/"&gt;esercizi commerciali&lt;/a&gt; che fanno i salutisti, i naturisti, gli ecologisti; dicono che ti offrono il caffè o il muffin se vai lì in bici, e tu ci vai, ma poi scopri che devi essere affiliato a qualche cosa (ciclohobby) che è gratis eh, e manco ti danno un tesserino, e quindi la prossima volta te lo diamo il caffè ma non oggi anche se sei l&amp;#8217;unico cretino che è arrivato lì in bici col freddo che&amp;nbsp;c&amp;#8217;è.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;il puzzo di inquinamento è asfissiante e&amp;nbsp;insopportabile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i negozi e i negozianti farebbero bene a svegliarsi perché non venderanno più una cippa appena muoiono quelli che ancora non si fidano a usare la carta di credito per gli acquisti online. Sono andato nel negozio di fotografia più professionale di Milano; cercavo un&amp;#8217;aggeggio piccolo, inusuale ma sicuramente professionale, e il vecchiaccio che mi ha dato credito (mentre come al solito gli altri del negozio pensavano ai cazzi loro) mi ha detto in modo brusco e scontroso &amp;#8220;ueeehhhh mica ce l&amp;#8217;abbiamo !!!&amp;#8221;. Io ci ho provato a far lavorare questi italiani ma dopo che mi sono fatto 25km di bici in pausa pranzo per andare a trovare &amp;#8216;staffare qui adesso lo ordino da un venditore cinese su ebay, e in vacca il principio del &amp;#8216;buy&amp;nbsp;local&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;scientific&amp;nbsp;writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great insights by &lt;a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/"&gt;drdrang&lt;/a&gt; on Dennis Ritchie (creator of C and co-creator of Unix) who died recently. To me it&amp;#8217;s yet another advice on the beauty of scientific writing and the combined effectiveness of brevity&amp;nbsp;clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarly papers have a reputation for dullness, but good ones aren’t dull to people who know, or want to learn, the topic.&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most C programming books could substitute as boat anchors; K&amp;amp;R is only half an inch thick but always seems to have the answer you’re looking for.&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clarity of these guys’ writing is undoubtedly a reflection of the clarity of their thoughts—the same clarity that makes Unix such a pleasure to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/10/dennis-ritchie-unix-and-clarity/"&gt;http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/10/dennis-ritchie-unix-and-clarity/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;prezzo di un&amp;nbsp;libro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questi erano degli appunti che avevo preso perché tempo fa mi stupivo del prezzo sproporzionato dei libri in formato Kindle rispetto ai libri veri, su carta. Mi chiedevo dunque quanto del prezzo di un libro cartaceo andasse agli autori, per poi trarre delle conclusioni sul giusto prezzo di un libro elettronico. Non sono mai riuscito a trarne delle conclusioni, anche perché a distanza di quasi tre anni finalmente i prezzi dei libri Kindle è sceso di parecchio&amp;nbsp;tanto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La vendita di un libro da $20 frutta al publisher (casa editrice?) $10. I costi che sostiene detto publisher&amp;nbsp;sono:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$3:&amp;nbsp;royalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2: printing / binding /&amp;nbsp;paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$1.20:&amp;nbsp;distribuzione&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2:&amp;nbsp;marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunque restano $1.80 con cui un publisher deve coprire costi di affitto, editing,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-books reduce the cost of printing, binding, and paper, but royalties tend to run higher, and all other costs are largely&amp;nbsp;unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(da &amp;#8220;Books After Amazon&amp;#8221;, di Onnesha Roychoudhuri, &lt;a href="http://www.bostonreview.net/BR35.6/roychoudhuri.php"&gt;http://www.bostonreview.net/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BR35&lt;/span&gt;.6/roychoudhuri.php&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;F.A.A.&lt;/span&gt; said pilots at the two airlines would not have to shut off and store their iPads during taxiing, takeoff and landing because they had demonstrated that the devices would not impair the functioning of onboard electronics. Alaska Airlines pilots, like passengers, still have to put their iPads away during those critical phases of the&amp;nbsp;flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(tratto da qualche articolo del New York Times di cui ho perso il&amp;nbsp;link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;riguardo l&amp;#8217;uso di parole come&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;negro&amp;#8221;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a small publisher, NewSouth Books, announced a new edition of Mark Twain’s &amp;#8220;Huckleberry Finn&amp;#8221; that will replace its uses of the word &amp;#8220;nigger&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;slave&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, as a writer, I see the strength of all the arguments against tinkering with the original, not least because it would be a terrible precedent &amp;#8212; start eliminating everything offensive in literary history, and yoùll have little left. But once I returned to the actual novel, I began to feel torn, because I could imagine the effect that its deluge of epithets would have on a young reader, especially a young black reader. (Open the book to the passage in the second chapter that begins, &amp;#8220;Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open,&amp;#8221; and see if you would be able to read it to a room full of ninth&amp;nbsp;graders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huckleberry Finn was intended, of course, as an attack on racism.&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da leggere per tutti coloro che s&amp;#8217;incagliano sulle parole senza pensare alle&amp;nbsp;azioni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;la&amp;nbsp;ragnatela&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovvero, uno strumento di valutazione delle capacità personali di&amp;nbsp;approfondimento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domanda: come si può valutare lo sforzo sostenuto da un appassionato di cinema quando ricerca il film perfetto, quello che lo appaga durante le due ore di visione e che lo riempie di emozioni, domande tali da portarlo a rifletterci su anche dopo che sono comparsi i titoli di coda&amp;nbsp;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risposta: la&amp;nbsp;ragnatela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qui avrei sviluppato l&amp;#8217;idea che un film perfetto, a mio parere, è uno talmente interessante che ti spinge a ripensarci su, ripercorrerlo, cercare di immergersi nel suo universo, e quindi continuare dunque a goderselo anche dopo averlo finito di vedere; ad esempio torni a casa e cerchi su internet notizie su attori, dettagli della trama, tecniche di ripresa, idee accennate, interpretazioni varie. Alternativamente, avrei definito la &lt;strong&gt;ragnatela&lt;/strong&gt; come quel sistema che ti permette attraverso riferimenti incrociati di critici autorevoli come Ebert o Scott di rintracciare altri film interessanti, come appunto una ragnatela che intesse il mondo cinematografico collegando piccoli e grandi film degni di essere visti. Onestamente non ricordo più quale delle due idee volessi sviluppare, ma ho lasciato due nomi di film e un link ad una recensione di Roger Ebert, che potrebbero farmi ricordare cosa diavolo&amp;nbsp;intendessi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esempi: Junebug,&amp;nbsp;Syriana&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La storiella delle scimmie e il legame con la filosofia corporate è divertente ed istruttiva. Leggetela qui: &lt;a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/05/python-3000/"&gt;http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/dec/05/python-3000/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham racconta una storia&amp;nbsp;simile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Periodic Table, Primo Levi tells a story that happened when he was working in a varnish factory. He was a chemist, and he was fascinated by the fact that the varnish recipe included a raw onion. What could it be for? No one knew; it was just part of the recipe. So he investigated, and eventually discovered that they had started throwing the onion in years ago to test the temperature of the varnish: if it was hot enough, the onion would&amp;nbsp;fry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask a MotoGP rider do drugs; or a mountain biker doing an downhill or enduro race; or a climber on a vertical wall in the Dolomites: none of these athletes will do drugs. That&amp;#8217;s because the core of their activity more technique than&amp;nbsp;physique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is why I have never liked too much road cycling and the marathons and swimming and weight lifting. Because it&amp;#8217;s 99% physical activity. Let an animal do such sports. Let the horses run, the dogs chase fake rabbits, and let&amp;#8217;s all cheer for the extreme power and awesomeness of them. And let&amp;#8217;s do standing ovations for men and women that do other kinds of sports, where to prevail you need coordination between mind and body, be it a natural talent or acquired through hard work and&amp;nbsp;exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="notes"></category><category term="moto"></category></entry><entry><title>wildlife photographer of the year</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-11-05:/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Si tratta probabilmente dell&amp;#8217;unica mostra a cui vado volentieri.

&lt;p&gt;Rispetto all&amp;#8217;edizione del 2009 che vidi a Londra, le foto qui sono stampate e non visualizzate su pannelli &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; retroilluminati; all&amp;#8217;epoca mi colpì molto la resa su questi schermi retroilluminati (non eravamo forse ancora abituati agli iPad) ma comunque nulla da dire &amp;#8212; le stampe sono sempre affascinanti e in questo caso anche ben&amp;nbsp;illuminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le didascalie che accompagnano ogni foto sono piene di informazioni tecniche (macchina utilizzata, eventuali supporti, flash, e altro ancora) e viene anche raccontata la storia dietro ogni scatto. Ma qui temo che i curatori (o magari gli stessi fotografi) si siano lasciati prendere la&amp;nbsp;mano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giudicate&amp;nbsp;voi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;He had been following the family in Kenya&amp;#8217;s Masai Mara for the past two weeks.[&amp;#8230;] Over the past 20 years, I have probably spent more time with cheetahs than any other animal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2721&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=3"&gt;Family tree&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In the end, he waited four days. Then, finally, nature obliged.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2754&amp;amp;category=49&amp;amp;year=2011"&gt;Ant line&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;After three days on a small boat looking for polar bears in Repulse Bay, Nunavut, Canada, Joe got lucky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2717&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=3"&gt;Polar power&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It took a couple of summers before I figured out how to photograph the scene.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2749&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=9"&gt;Boy meets nature&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Stephane took two hours to walk to Creux du Van in western Switzerland, laden with heavy equipment.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2769&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=12"&gt;Celestial arch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomma, se non fatichi un po&amp;#8217;, pare che la giuria non ti prenda in&amp;nbsp;considerazione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sto dunque valutando se partecipare il prossimo anno con queste due&amp;nbsp;fotografie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7653060226/" title="_D7K1491 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7653060226_bfe3903a8a_z.jpg" width="424" height="640" alt="_D7K1491"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Erano mesi che inseguivo questa volpe nella ostile campagna Piemontese. Volevo catturare una immagine forte che simboleggiasse i pericoli continui che fronteggiano questo ormai sparuto gruppo di bestie selvatiche, inseguite dalle micidiali armi del progresso. Ma questa volpe era incredibilmente furba e riusciva sempre a schivare tutte le auto. Quindi alla fine presi la situazione in pugno, preparai un complesso sistema di quattro flash, due pannelli riflettenti, tre Nikon D4 che avrebbero scattato in modo sincrono per documentare l&amp;#8217;avvenuto (e tirai pure fuori l&amp;#8217;iPhone che non si sa mai); poi mi misi sul mio &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt;, partii a razzo e finalmente tirai sotto questa maledettissima&amp;nbsp;volpe&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/8132916445/" title="_1060026 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8196/8132916445_2d9bf39d6b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="_1060026"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Ero in Madagascar, in un rettilario vicino al mio resort cinque stelle. Erano dieci giorni che saltavo il dolce per trovare un momento senza nessun fottuto turista. Con grande coraggio, un giorno saltai anche il secondo e finalmente riuscii ad avere cinque minuti di solitudine a tu per tu col feroce e rapidissimo camaleonte malgascio, che fotografai con la mia Canon 1D e  105mm Macro f/1.4 (e tirai fuori l&amp;#8217;iPhone che non si sa&amp;nbsp;mai)&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="photo"></category><category term="quote"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>fotografia estemporanea o ragionata</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-10-19-fotografia-ragionata.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-19T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-10-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-10-19:/2012-10-19-fotografia-ragionata.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Qualche tempo fa cercavo uno sfogo per la mia fotografia.

L&amp;#8217;ho trovato pubblicando i miei &lt;a href="tags.html#weekly%20snaps-ref"&gt;weekly snaps&lt;/a&gt;; collezioni atematiche di fotografie scattate in diverse condizioni temporali, geografiche ed emozionali. O, evitando il pretenzioso vocabolario da pseudo artista e usando parole più terra terra, raccolta di foto prese un po&amp;#8217; a casaccio dai miei&amp;nbsp;archivi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In questi post periodici mostro foto che non fanno parte di un progetto organico, ma che in qualche modo conservano un posto speciale nella mia memoria; solitamente cerco di pubblicare foto che siano almeno dal punto di vista tecnico ineccepibili. La scelta e riuscita di ognuna di queste mini raccolte deve appagare solo e soltanto me in quanto sono un modo per incanalare la mia energia fotografica; così facendo evito anche il lungo e rigoroso processo di selezione a cui mi sentirei obbligato se dovessi presentare il lavoro ad un pubblico&amp;nbsp;giudicante. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quindi i weekly snaps&amp;nbsp;sono:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leggeri da preparare perché non c&amp;#8217;è nessuna&amp;nbsp;aspettativa;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veloci nell&amp;#8217;assemblare perché posso raggruppare immagini con temi e elaborazioni differenti mischiando bianco nero e colore, foto di famiglia con nature&amp;nbsp;morte;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;appaganti perché sono uno sfogo creativo e un&amp;#8217;illusione di prodotto&amp;nbsp;finito;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istruttivi perché costringono ad esercitare il mio senso critico scegliendo delle foto che abbiano valore oggettivo e non soggettivo, dove per valore intendo un qualche merito artistico (composizione originale o interessante), tecnico (messa a fuoco perfetta o post-processing che esalta colori e tonalità), narrativo (c&amp;#8217;è una storia che si intuisce? è una foto capace di&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;raccontare&amp;#8221;?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma comunque mi rendo conto che restano un&amp;#8217;esercizio, un divertissement abbastanza volatile &amp;#8212; laddove invece un &amp;#8220;vero&amp;#8221; fotografo sceglie un tema e si costruisce dei progetti come ad esempio: skateboarders festaioli; palazzi in costruzione; la miseria nei sobborghi urbani; malati di malattie incurabili; riccastri con automobili d&amp;#8217;epoca; foglie autunnali; fiori di montagna; montagne della Patagonia; ghiacciai in scioglimento; i pasti dei voli intercontinentali; &lt;a href="http://ink361.com/#/users/2934728/photos"&gt;oggetti rotondi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il &amp;#8220;vero&amp;#8221; fotografo alla fine crea un corpus organico di foto unite solitamente da pensiero (il tema sviluppato) e stile (coerenza pittorica data da un certo stile di elaborazione dei colori o scelta del medium espressivo o uso di certe focali); noto che a volte, tristemente, il senso artistico è dato unicamente dalla scelta a priori del tema, tipico di troppa arte-fuffa che si esibisce in mostre o su riviste patinate. In realtà esistono dei casi in cui il piano d&amp;#8217;azione è qualcosa di effimero ma che acquista un suo senso solo perché nessuno l&amp;#8217;ha mai fatto prima; ad esempio, autoritratti scattati con un qualche arcano processo che predata la pellicola&lt;sup id="fnref:nota"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  Come diceva qualcuno, magari l'artista aveva lo stesso impulso che spinge centinaia di persone normali a vendere le proprie reflex e decidere di scattare solo con il proprio iPhone. Però un conto è scattare con iPhone, un conto è scattare con una medio formato e lastre metalliche; un conto è applicare la grana in post-processing con Snapseed, un'altro è sviluppare in camera oscura con soluzioni chimiche che ti ci vuole un PhD per non scioglierti le sopracciglia. E alla fine la comunità artistiche chiaramente premia l'originalone che scatta con metodi antiquati, probabilmente ottendendo delle schifezze di foto che tutti cestinerebbero se fossero state scattate con un iPhone; ma siccome sono state scattate con medio-formato e sviluppate con Rodinal allora acquisiscono un significato e una valenza artistica superiore; vengono cioè innegabilmente sopravvalutate solo sulla base della tecnica di ripresa; giusto o sbagliato? Secondo me sbagliato, il valore di una foto dovrebbe essere annegato nella foto stessa, e bisognerebbe giudicarla a prescindere dal processo creativo. Una foto vale tanto quanto l'immagine che restituisce, sia che tu abbia scattato con un iPhone che con una Leica che con una reflex amatoriale. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resta il fatto che una foto a sé, priva di contesto o isolata, ha vita breve, sopratutto in un momento storico come questo in cui anneghiamo in un oceano di fotografie convogliate da diverse fonti (email; riviste online; social networks come  twitter o facebook); come riprova di questo, vedo il successo e l&amp;#8217;interesse che suscita &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/"&gt;il lavoro dei &amp;#8220;curatori&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;È per questo che mi chiedo se abbia senso continuare con una pubblicazione estemporanea di foto come i miei weekly snaps; se sia necessario anche solo per stimolare la mia creatività abbracciare un progetto di qualsiasi tipo e vedere cosa ne salta&amp;nbsp;fuori.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invariabilmente le mie raccolte più organiche di fotografie sono sempre relative a viaggi o eventi sociali (matrimonio di qualche amico, la cresima della nipote; il ritrovo con amici), e quindi spesso soffrono nella fase di selezione da un elemento emotivo che non voglio togliere e a cui non posso rinunciare. Ad esempio, foto non perfette di un qualche momento speciale che devo condidere con l&amp;#8217;amico con cui ho fatto il viaggio, non posso (voglio) cancellarle dalla mia&amp;nbsp;selezione. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E quindi un progetto puramente fotografico svolgerebbe anche una funzione di fuga da queste costrizioni, e potrebbe fornire un insieme di immagini che (finalmente!) potrei giudicare e selezione ed editare unicamente in base a criteri quanto più oggettivi&amp;nbsp;possibili. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Idee per&amp;nbsp;progetti:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;le grondaie di&amp;nbsp;Milano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;portoni e&amp;nbsp;piccioni&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lungo i canali navigabili di Milano (Navigli, Muzza,&amp;nbsp;etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;periferia e città&amp;nbsp;dormitorio&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The images themselves are glass-plate ambrotype positives straight from the camera, made with the wet-plate collodion process—an archaic, laborious technique dating back to photography’s earliest days. As in the majority of her recent work, the medium’s finickiness and imperfections give Mann’s self-portraits a haunted, Faulkner-esque tone—transforming them from straight photographs into objects resembling long-lost artifacts from a forgotten time.&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="http://www.americanphotomag.com/photo-gallery/2012/10/wall-sally-manns-self-portraits-new-york"&gt;http://www.americanphotomag.com/photo-gallery/2012/10/wall-sally-manns-self-portraits-new-york&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 1: &amp;#8220;Spoiled Rotten&amp;#8221; by Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;L.A.&lt;/span&gt; families observed, no child routinely performed household chores without being instructed to. Often, the kids had to be begged to attempt the simplest tasks; often, they still&amp;nbsp;refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Yanira had no clear role in the group, she quickly found ways to make herself useful. Twice a day, she swept the sand off the sleeping mats, and she helped stack the kapashi leaves for transport back to the village. In the evening, she fished for crustaceans, which she cleaned, boiled, and served to the others. Calm and self-possessed, Yanira “asked for nothing,” Izquierdo later recalled. The girl’s behavior made a strong impression on the anthropologist because at the time of the trip Yanira was just six years&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Most parents today were brought up in a culture that put a strong emphasis on being special, (&amp;#8230;) being special takes hard work and can’t be trusted to children. Hence the exhausting cycle of constantly monitoring their work and performance, which in turn makes children feel less competent and confident, so that they need even more&amp;nbsp;oversight.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) today’s incoming freshmen are less likely to be concerned about the rigors of higher education than &amp;#8220;about how they will handle the logistics of everyday&amp;nbsp;life&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, according to “Life at Home,” are disproportionate generators of clutter: “Each new child in a household leads to a 30 percent increase in a family’s inventory of possessions during the preschool years alone.” Many of the kids’ rooms pictured are so crowded with clothes and toys, so many of which have been tossed on the floor, that there is no path to the&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 2: &amp;#8220;Raising Successful Children&amp;#8221; by Madeline&amp;nbsp;Levine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is autonomous, confident and generally in accord with reality. If you treat your walking toddler as if she can’t walk, you diminish her confidence and distort reality. Ditto nightly “reviews” of homework, repetitive phone calls to “just check if you’re O.K.” and “editing” (read: writing) your child’s college application&amp;nbsp;essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging back and allowing children to make mistakes is one of the greatest challenges of&amp;nbsp;parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having tutors prep your anxious 3-year-old for a preschool interview because all your friends’ children are going to this particular school or pushing your exhausted child to take one more advanced-placement course because it will ensure her spot as class valedictorian is not involved parenting but toxic overparenting aimed at meeting the parents’ need for status or affirmation and not the child’s&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) the child’s job is to grow, yours is to control your anxiety so it doesn’t get in the way of his reasonable moves toward autonomy&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents also have to make sure their own lives are fulfilling. There is no parent more vulnerable to the excesses of overparenting than an unhappy parent One of the most important things we do for our children is to present them with a version of adult life that is appealing and worth striving&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) schools that worship at the altar of high achievement but do everything they can to undermine children’s growth and well-being: eliminating recess; assigning mind-deadening amounts of homework; and ranking, measuring and valuing kids by narrowly focused test scores, while cutting out other areas of creative education in which large numbers of students who don’t necessarily test well might find success and&amp;nbsp;thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) the inconvenient truth remains that not every child can be shaped and accelerated into Harvard material. But all kids can have their spirits broken, depression induced and anxiety stoked by too much stress, too little downtime and too much attention given to external factors that make them look good to an audience of appraising eyes but leave them feeling rotten&amp;nbsp;inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 4: &amp;#8220;America’s Top Parent - What’s behind the Tiger Mother craze?&amp;#8221;  by Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chua, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, is a Yale Law School professor. She is married to another Yale law professor and has two daughters, whom she drives relentlessly (&amp;#8230;) In Chua’s binary world, there are just two kinds of mother. There are “Chinese mothers,” who, she allows, do not necessarily have to be Chinese (&amp;#8230;) Then, there are “Western” mothers. (&amp;#8230;) Chua chooses the instruments that her daughters will play and stands over them as they practice for three, four, sometimes five hours at a&amp;nbsp;stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Yes, you can brute-force any kid to learn to play the piano—just precisely like his or her billion neighbors&amp;#8221; is how one of the comments on the Wall Street Journal’s Web site put it. &amp;#8220;But you’ll never get a Jimi Hendrix that&amp;nbsp;way&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about the only category in which American students outperform the competition is self-regard&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting is hard. As anyone who has gone through the process and had enough leisure (and still functioning brain cells) to reflect on it knows, a lot of it is a crapshoot. Things go wrong that you have no control over, and, on occasion, things also go right, and you have no control over those, either. The experience is scary and exhilarating and often humiliating, not because you’re disappointed in your kids, necessarily, but because you’re disappointed in&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only book I&amp;#8217;ve read is by an italian philosophy professor, Stefano Zecchi, who recounts a nice tale about parenting at a late age, being frequently mistaken by his son&amp;#8217;s grandfather, and some clever observations on the declining importance of the dad in today&amp;#8217;s family.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-zecchi" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s edited by a fellow italian who writes excellent english (unlike the rest of us), and it was a place to read reasoned commentaries that I&amp;nbsp;enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lately, like most of the other tech blogs, it has changed to a collection of commentaries on brainless apps, such as: twitter clients, calendar and reminder apps, plain-text editors. I&amp;#8217;m the first one to acknowledge the importance of simple apps to make our everyday life easier, and in fact I&amp;#8217;ve been using Simplenote and NValt for ages. But come on, do we really need to read and review shitloads of stupid apps to keep track of menial tasks? To write using fucking Helvetica? Yet another app to see what the hell I&amp;#8217;m supposed to do today or to share crappily filtered&amp;nbsp;photos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this what computing has come to, after the demise of internet reduced to a Facebook&amp;nbsp;medium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the excitement when I first used Netscape to access the world; I remember the first times I visited &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815054252/http://www.photo.net/"&gt;Philip Greenspun&amp;#8217;s photo.net&lt;/a&gt;. Where&amp;#8217;s all the smart and clever people now? All these bloggers endlessly ruminating on Apple shares and stock market? Who cares (except those who make real oney out of it)? Better yet: who the fuck is really interested to see another debate on Android vs iOS? About &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s stock prices? I don&amp;#8217;t, but maybe I&amp;#8217;m in the minority (as&amp;nbsp;always).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what I enjoyed the most yesterday? The single-minded focus of a friend of mine who has plenty of things to say but decided to put some words out there &lt;a href="http://www.astrodan.com"&gt;on a blog&lt;/a&gt; talking about his newfound passion, astrophotography. Just that; simple focus, sharp writing, ideas that flow. That&amp;#8217;s what internet is all about. Not discussions on stockmarket and calendar&amp;nbsp;apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please Federico, find some stimulating new apps among the zillions that are on the AppStore. Let&amp;#8217;s read something on new concepts and ideas. Let&amp;#8217;s discuss about something radically different, such&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using iPads in the fields to discuss geology, take photos on the fly of a carbonatic outcrop in the Maiella and draw unconformities on&amp;nbsp;it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interpret and map earthquakes pulling out information from geophysical&amp;nbsp;institutes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how professional photographers use their iPads to display and edit&amp;nbsp;shots;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not how I can shoot a video of my dog using the iPhone but how that guy that filmed the story of an old rusty bycicle did&amp;nbsp;that;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not the same old tutorial on Photoshop and &amp;#8220;how to remove blemishes from your ugly aunt&amp;#8221; but stories about how some graphic artist or photographer composed his photobook or&amp;nbsp;blog;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not interviews to the same 10 nerds (Gruber Blanc Arment Susanna Agnelli Monti Pirelli dribbla Causio che passa a Tardelli) that don&amp;#8217;t do nothing but write about how to do things (I&amp;#8217;m sick of getting things done and checklist apps and planner and other shit like this) but some mac nerd from academia or engineering or law that can give his thoughts about how he do&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si chiama &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org"&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; ed è come se fossero i ritagli di giornale che vorresti mettere da parte; parla di creatività, di scienza, di filosofia, di psicologia; parla di qualsiasi argomento interessi la sua creatrice Maria Popova, di qualsiasi cosa che stimoli la sua curiosità. Come dice il sito stesso, Brain Pickings è &amp;#8220;uno scrigno del tesoro fatto di mattoncini &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E in quest&amp;#8217;epoca in cui si scopre che Google, dopo tutto, è malvagio come qualsiasi altra mega corporation; in cui non si parla più di &lt;em&gt;amici&lt;/em&gt; perché i &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; ormai sono quelli di Facebook; in cui stimati giornalisti si affidano a Twitter per fare del reportage; in cui i blog più famosi ti danno contenuti superficiali in cambio di qualche click &amp;#8212; e nel frattempo raccolgono informazioni su cosa compri, cosa mangi, con chi esci&lt;sup id="fnref:nota"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; in quest&amp;#8217;epoca è piacevole imbattersi in un sito fatto con cura, che ti arricchisce, ed è assolutamente privo di pubblicità o secondi&amp;nbsp;fini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La newsletter di finesettimana poi è una delizia, perché riporta gli articoli completi e quindi permette una lettura tranquilla, senza costringerti ad inseguire i&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell&amp;#8217;ultima edizione c&amp;#8217;è un bellissimo articolo che mi ha fatto scoprire questi &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/02/07/david-ogilvy-on-writing/"&gt;10 consigli per scrivere bene di David Ogilvy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utili secondo me sia per chi vuol migliorare la propria capacità di scrivere bene sia materiale tecnico (rapporti lavorativi ad esempio) che non (blogs, racconti di viaggio, recensioni di&amp;nbsp;videogiochi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non li traduco in italiano per timore di denudarli della loro&amp;nbsp;efficacia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mather. People who think well, write&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly&amp;nbsp;speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10&amp;nbsp;hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the way you talk.&amp;nbsp;Naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use short words, short sentences and short&amp;nbsp;paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious&amp;nbsp;ass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never write more than two pages on any&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your&amp;nbsp;quotations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning — and then edit&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something important, get a colleague to improve&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACTION&lt;/span&gt;, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tale proposito, consiglio la lettura di un paio di articoli che parlano di &amp;#8220;Big Data&amp;#8221;: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/big-data/"&gt;http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/big-data/&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Il fatto che né &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.com/2011-12-20-winter-riding-milano-episode-1.html"&gt;l&amp;#8217;episodio 1&lt;/a&gt; né &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.com/2012-02-09-winter-riding-milano-episode-2.html"&gt;il 2&lt;/a&gt; abbiano vinto il titolo di video della settimana. E che siano stati premiati video che riprendono riding banale o che mostrano sciatteria nelle riprese o&amp;nbsp;nell&amp;#8217;editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dovrei essere contento dei risultati visto che il primo episodio, &lt;a href="http://video.mtb-forum.it/videos/view/1586"&gt;messo online su mtb-forum&lt;/a&gt; il 19 dicembre 2011, aveva dopo circa un mese (13 gennaio 2012) 6608 views e 51 &amp;#8220;mi piace&amp;#8221;. Sicuramente aiutato dalla &lt;a href="http://www.mtb-forum.it/video-winter-riding-milano/"&gt;pubblicazione in prima pagina sul magazine di mtb-forum.it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il secondo, &lt;a href="http://video.mtb-forum.it/videos/view/1685"&gt;online dal 10 gennaio 2012&lt;/a&gt; dopo 3 giorni aveva già 1688 views e 31 &amp;#8220;mi piace&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il titolo di video della settimana viene assegnato automaticamente a chi prende più &amp;#8220;mi piace&amp;#8221;, quindi alla fine serve molto la spinta pubblicitaria ma anche una certa concessione al gusto comune. Per questo penso sia facile raccogliere il consenso popolare mostrando un video di generico &amp;#8216;freeride&amp;#8217; con dei tizi neanche troppo bravi che saltano su e giù sempre sullo stesso pistino oppure solleticando il grezzo palato da cinepanettone mostrando un tipo sovrappeso che va su e giù per il sentiero a piazzare la telecamera per le autoriprese (e ridicolizzando il tutto con accelerazione del frame rate e colonna sonora tipo Benny&amp;nbsp;Hill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La mia idea invece è mostrare del riding vero, fatto da persone normali; trasmettere la passione e intensità, l&amp;#8217;entusiasmo che ognuno di noi prova mentre va in bici, a prescindere dalle proprie doti tecniche o da situazioni&amp;nbsp;straordinarie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E non ci vuole una super bici né &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/EqYgAX6D43Q"&gt;Danny Hart&lt;/a&gt;; non ci vuole attrezzatura di ripresa professionale né editing o effetti speciali. Ma ci vuole rispetto per chi alla fine vedrà il tuo video, cioè per l&amp;#8217;altro appassionato come te che vuole godersi un pizzico di libertà prima di andare in ufficio o a scuola. Selezionare il materiale, scartare le schifezze, cercare la musica di accompagnamento che vada in sintonia col posto e in armonia col ritmo dell&amp;#8217;azione. Editare con cura, produrre un condensato di quello che provi. Un minuto secco, una pillola di benessere, ritrovare la bellezza del&amp;nbsp;quotidiano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspirare a&amp;nbsp;questo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#8217;t be just a coincidence that the sex most interested in exploration is the sex most obsessed with acquiring gear. When Homo habilis fabricated stone tools 2.5 million years ago, his immediate impulse was probably to lead an expedition across the savanna looking for an excuse to use them &amp;#8212; and then sell the gear to the rest of the&amp;nbsp;clan.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E&amp;nbsp;poi:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grail for glory-seeking explorers has always been the excruciatingly bad trip &amp;#8212; Ulysses would be unknown if he had taken the easy way home &amp;#8212; but it is becoming more and more elusive. How can anyone go to Ellesmere today and compete with the old stories? Modern explorers are often dismissed as puny imitations of yesterday&amp;#8217;s titans, but watching Schurke, I could see that their problem is just the opposite. They&amp;#8217;re too good &amp;#8212; too well equipped, too experienced, too skilled and fit. They&amp;#8217;re like the best of the old explorers, the Norwegians like Sverdrup and Roald Amundsen (the winner of the race to the South Pole), whose books didn&amp;#8217;t sell because the authors lacked the British and American flair for blundering into trouble and exaggerating their&amp;nbsp;accomplishments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the famous old polar explorers could never keep up with Schurke and other modern professionals, like the skiers in recent years who have made astonishing trips across the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica man-hauling all their supplies. Robert Scott was an inept skier; Shackleton was a heavy smoker with a heart condition; Peary couldn&amp;#8217;t ski and had a hard enough time walking. They often showed appalling ignorance in their equipment and plans, like Scott&amp;#8217;s decision to use ponies instead of dogs. Shackleton actually tried to drive a car on a South Pole expedition. (It didn&amp;#8217;t move an&amp;nbsp;inch.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quindi essere dei montanari incapaci è un vantaggio dal punto di vista&amp;nbsp;letterario. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>martin gardner on the road</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-04-19-martin-gardner-on-the-road.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-19T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-04-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2010-04-19:/2010-04-19-martin-gardner-on-the-road.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Avevo da tempo in casa una versione di Alice in Wonderland annotata da Martin Gardner, famoso editor della colonna di giochi matematici di Scientific&amp;nbsp;American.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gardner commenta (nota 6, p.89): &amp;#8220;These remarks are among the most quoted passages in the Alice books. A recent echo is heard in Jack Kerouac&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;forgettable&lt;/strong&gt; novel, On The Road&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&amp;#8221;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner scriveva queste note negli anni &amp;#8216;60, e colpisce questo giudizio perentorio dato a Kerouac, visto che al giorno d&amp;#8217;oggi il libretto di Kerouac e&amp;#8217; considerato come una delle &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html"&gt;colonne portanti della letteratura americana&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vibram con la linea Five Fingers […] ha visto le sue vendite triplicare ogni anno, dopo il lancio nel&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibram says sales of its FiveFingers have tripled every year since they were introduced in 2006&amp;nbsp;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ora tremano i colossi, che rappresentano un fatturato annuo da 17 miliardi di&amp;nbsp;dollari.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] significant impact on not only running shoes but also on the broader $17 billion sports shoe&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Lieberman, docente di biologia evolutiva a Harvard, è uno degli scienziati che sostiene la &amp;#8220;scarpa invisibile&amp;#8221;. […] &amp;#8220;Non esistono prove che le scarpe sportive abbiano migliorato la condizione di chi&amp;nbsp;corre&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;There&amp;#8217;s not a lot of evidence that runing shoes have made people better off&amp;#8221;, said Daniel E. Lieberman, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard&amp;nbsp;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;È arrivato alla stessa conclusione il medico Craig Richards della facoltà di medicina di Newcastle in Australia, il cui studio sarà pubblicato sul British Journal of Sports Medicine: &amp;#8220;Non esiste una sola indagine clinica che abbia dimostrato i benefici delle scarpe molleggiate o protettive, nel prevenire i danni fisici o nel migliorare i risultati&amp;nbsp;sportivi&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Craig Richards, a researcher at the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Newcastle in Australia […] could not find a single clinical study showing that cushioned or corrective running shoes prevented injury or improved performance. His findings were published last year in The British Journal of Sports&amp;nbsp;Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Il loro idolo era Abebe Bikila, il leggendario maratoneta etiope che vinse alle Olimpiadi di Roma del 1960 correndo a piedi&amp;nbsp;nudi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Abebe Bikila, an Ethiopian runner, caused a stir when he ran the marathon barefoot and&amp;nbsp;won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;La stessa Vibram quando inventò la linea Cinque Dita all&amp;#8217;inizio pensava di rivolgersi a nicchie di mercato come gli appassionati di kayak o di&amp;nbsp;yoga.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Vibram, an Italian company known for its rugged rubber soles, designed the FiveFingers a few years ago, company officials figured that they would appeal to boaters, kayakers and&amp;nbsp;yogis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lo si deve al successo di nuovi metodi di allenamento - ChiRunning e Pose Method - popolarizzato nei paesi angloamericani da un best-seller, &amp;#8220;Born to Run&amp;#8221;, cioè nati per&amp;nbsp;correre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But popular training methods like ChiRunning and the Pose Method that promote a more “natural” gait, as well as “Born to Run,” a best-selling new book about long-distance running by Christopher McDougall, have helped spur&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perciò il nostro piede è uno strumento che l&amp;#8217;evoluzione delle specie ha disegnato alla perfezione: per sostenerci nella corsa, ed anche come &amp;#8220;sensore&amp;#8221; di tutte le asperità del terreno, pronto a segnalarci i pericoli che possono rappresentare per la nostra&amp;nbsp;salute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of this approach contend that naked feet are perfectly capable of running long distances, and that encasing them in the fortress of modern footwear weakens foot muscles and ligaments and blocks vital sensory input about&amp;nbsp;terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Galahad Clark, fondatore a Londra di Terra Plana che è un altro produttore di &amp;#8220;scarpe invisibili&amp;#8221;, trae la conclusione: le superscarpe tecnologiche vendute dai colossi dell&amp;#8217;abbigliamento sportivo &amp;#8220;sono come delle bare, imprigionano il piede e gli impediscono di svolgere le sue funzioni&amp;nbsp;essenziali&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The shoe arguably got in the way of evolution,” said Galahad Clark, a seventh-generation shoemaker and chief executive of the shoemaker Terra Plana, based in London. “They’re like little foot coffins that stopped the foot from working the way it’s supposed to&amp;nbsp;work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;È in totale disaccordo Lewis Maharam, consulente medico dei New York Road Runners (il club dei maratoneti newyorchesi): &amp;#8220;Correre a piedi nudi va bene per chi ha una costituzione bio-meccanica perfetta, per il restante 95% della popolazione è una ricetta sicura per finire&amp;nbsp;all&amp;#8217;ospedale&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 95 percent of the population or higher, running barefoot will land you in my office,” said Dr. Lewis G. Maharam, medical director for the New York Road Runners, the group that organizes the New York City Marathon. “A very small number of people are biomechanically perfect,” he said, so most need some sort of supportive or corrective&amp;nbsp;footwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rampini dovrebbe citare il New York Times per&amp;nbsp;danni&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi stupisco che non l&amp;#8217;abbia ancora fatto. Un chiaro esempio di plagio. Certo, la povera Amy Cortese non ha il dono della sintesi di Rampini; scopiazzando gli appunti segreti del giornalista italiano, riempe il suo articolo di troppi dettagli (nomi, fatti, numeri) su cui il &amp;#8216;nostro&amp;#8217; non si&amp;nbsp;sofferma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per non parlare degli errori da novellina della povera Amy. Ad esempio, parlando del dr.Craig Richards scrive che i risultati della sua ricerca sono stati pubblicati lo scorso anno nel British Journal of Sports Medicine, sbagliando clamorosamente i tempi; infatti, dice Rampini, tale studio &amp;#8220;sarà pubblicato sul British Journal of Sports&amp;nbsp;Medicine&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imbarazzante constatare la scarsa affidabilità della stessa rivista scientifica, visto che sul loro sito risulta che la data di pubblicazione dell&amp;#8217;articolo in questione (&lt;a href="http://bjsm.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/43/3/159"&gt;&amp;#8220;Is your prescription of distance running shoes evidence-based ?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;) risale ad aprile&amp;nbsp;2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infine stendiamo il proverbiale velo sulla conoscenza della lingua italiana di Amy Cortese. Quando infatti Rampini&amp;nbsp;scrive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;L&amp;#8217;autore del libro &amp;#8216;Born to Run&amp;#8217;, Christopher McDougall, ricorda che l&amp;#8217;essere umano è una macchina geneticamente programmata per la corsa: è così che i nostri antenati sono sopravvissuti alle belve feroci che li braccavano, e a loro volta hanno potuto alimentarsi di&amp;nbsp;selvaggina.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La giornalista del New York Times&amp;nbsp;riporta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Lieberman’s research suggests that two million years ago, our ancestors’ ability to run long distances helped them outlast their prey&amp;nbsp;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sbagliando quindi sia l&amp;#8217;attribuzione della frase (non lo scrittore McDougall ma il prof. Lieberman) che il significato stesso; si è mai sentito di un uomo preistorico che grazie alla capacità di correre a lungo riusciva a sfiancare la sua vittima (&lt;em&gt;prey&lt;/em&gt;) ? Macché… meno male che c&amp;#8217;è Rampini a dirci invece che l&amp;#8217;uomo preistorico correva per sfuggire alle &amp;#8220;belve feroci&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;predators&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Giustizia è&amp;nbsp;fatta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consiglio all&amp;#8217;autorevole &lt;a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Rampini"&gt;Rampini&lt;/a&gt; di mettersi al riparo da eventuali dubbi di plagio che potrebbero ritorcersi contro di lui sulla base delle date di pubblicazione dei due articoli citando, ad esempio, tutte le fonti a cui ha attinto per scrivere questo suo&amp;nbsp;pezzo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category><category term="links"></category></entry><entry><title>new york times on geothermal energy</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2009-06-25-new-york-times-on-geothermal-energy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-25T12:29:00+02:00</published><updated>2009-06-25T12:29:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2009-06-25:/2009-06-25-new-york-times-on-geothermal-energy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the&amp;nbsp;article: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is one very nice and informed comment from a PhD student that puts things into the right&amp;nbsp;perspective:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The major difference between enhanced geothermal and standard oil and gas extraction is the high pressures used to create geothermal reservoirs. Oil and gas are normally extracted from porous sedimentary rocks (10-30% void space), but the heat fluxes required for geothermal are found in volcanic rocks with less than 1% void space. The rock must be fractured to allow water to flow through it, and it is this process that causes earthquakes. The earthquakes can continue for months after the pressure has been released because the Earth is a dynamic place and not all of the stress transfer is instantaneous; in fact, the later-occurring quakes are usually governed by stress changes caused by diffusion (slow filtering through the limited porosity due to pressure gradients) rather than advection (the injection velocity/pressure, which causes the immediate&amp;nbsp;earthquakes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) There is no danger of creating &amp;#8220;new tectonic plates&amp;#8221;; the tectonic plates are on a completely different scale than a single geothermal reservoir (1000s vs 1s of kilometers). The absolute worst case scenario would be changing the stress regime enough to reactivate an existing tectonic-scale fault like the San Andreas/San Jacinto etc., which is very unlikely due to the scale&amp;nbsp;difference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) For risk assessment purposes, risk is the product of hazard (the event that might be triggered) and vulnerability. A project like this ends up going forward because when the hazard is large (i.e. it is very likely that you will trigger small earthquakes), the vulnerability is also low since it will only affect a relatively sparsely populated area immediately nearby. Obviously, if you happen to live in that area, that is not a reassuring argument. In the other extreme case, if the vulnerability is high (eg. a Landers earthquake-type rupture across most of SoCal), the hazard is low (the chance of re-activating the San Andreas is slim). In both cases, the product of the two works out to a small number, so the risk is deemed acceptable. The soft underbelly of risk assessment is that seismic hazard is fiendishly difficult to quantify given present methodology and observational&amp;nbsp;capabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Regional seismic hazard and geothermal energy will continue to be coupled since the areas with the highest geothermal gradients (rate of temperature increase with depth) tend to be tectonically active (young or recently deformed) crust. However, the potential benefits to figuring out geothermal energy are myriad - clean, reliable, domestic supplies - and I think it&amp;#8217;s worth pursuing. An exciting tangential scientific opportunity also exists: if we can figure out the processes that control microseismicity in reservoirs, we will be much closer to predicting and someday mitigating the types of earthquakes that make headlines on a more regular&amp;nbsp;basis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) This may come as a surprise, but the largest geothermal producer in the world is the oil giant Chevron; they have several enormous traditional geothermal projects in&amp;nbsp;Indonesia.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting piece was published a few days ago on the official google blog: &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html"&gt;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me quote two&amp;nbsp;passages:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much nicer if we had a device with great connectivity that could do searches without interruption.

&lt;p&gt;An interesting piece was published a few days ago on the official google blog: &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html"&gt;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me quote two&amp;nbsp;passages:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much nicer if we had a device with great connectivity that could do searches without interruption. One far-fetched idea: how about a wearable device that does searches in the background based on the words it picks up from conversations, and then flashes relevant&amp;nbsp;facts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s our straightforward definition of the ideal search engine? Your best friend with instant access to all the world’s facts and a photographic memory of everything you’ve seen and&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea is (to me) scary as hell. Do I really want the electronic equivalent of the know-it-all friend that is constantly &amp;#8216;flashing&amp;#8217; information, little pieces of knowledge when I try to follow the stream of my thoughts or a conversation with a friend ? No thanks, I&amp;#8217;d rather be alone and do the search later on (and only on things that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; care&amp;nbsp;about).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already feel like too much data is around us. This is like calling for information overload, and the risk is that you won&amp;#8217;t be able to gather your own thinking, your own ideas, because somebody else in the world has already done that. Well that&amp;#8217;s certainly true but then you would become a data collector, or a data linker. A man needs to reinvent the wheel every now and again, otherwise he loses the perception of his inner mental strength, or the ability to think for&amp;nbsp;himself.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quotation then: it sounds like the official definition of search engine according to google. Don&amp;#8217;t you think that it looks very similar to the idea of the superentity that is present in so many science fiction tales ? The superentity that invariably decides to go against humanity (other scenario: tries to help the humanity in its own distorted way, like for example exterminating 99% of the population leaving only the genetically advanced alive)&amp;nbsp;? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry></feed>
