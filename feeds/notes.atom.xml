&lt;!-- Modern-day, first-world emigrants who leave their countries with good jobs already waiting for them on the other side have it all easy and it's difficult to establish any sort of narrative that makes your experience worth something compared to the textbook examples of our early-twentieth century grandfathers.

But the smell and the cool breeze of the sea when I get off the plane at Palese airport, the harsh local slang, are universal. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time (around March 2017) I made a point of taking a camera&lt;sup id="fnref:camera"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:camera"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on my walks and photograph what are objectively banal, everyday scenes. After many months locked away, I have looked again at these photos and found them to be true, sincere, little snapshots of Bari and I like them for what they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original idea was to build a short series of interesting, meaningful vignettes of my hometown &amp;#8212; but the plan failed&amp;nbsp;miserably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably should have done a bit of planning beforehand and not just go around on foot, hopeful that serendipity would help me out like it has done several times&amp;nbsp;already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual shots &amp;#8220;work&amp;#8221; for me when I&amp;#8217;m on holiday in some new place; i find photos just happening before me, they are satisfying from a technical standpoint, and remind me of good, unique places or situations (see &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2017-02-12-pretty-pictures-of-cuba.md"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m in a familiar place like my hometown there is so much that I have to fight, like the boredom of looking at places that I know so well and see them with new eyes. I&amp;#8217;d love to make other people understand why I love my hometown so much despite hating probably 90℅ of everything that&amp;#8217;s in&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I missed so many things: the blinding sun of early March, the squalid but somehow rich urban landscapes from the periphery of the city center, the smell and the cool breeze of the sea when I get off the plane at Palese airport, the harsh local slang, the placid queues of the immigrants near the police station, in stark contrast with the barely contained disdain that every last one of the Bari&amp;#8217;s inhabitants display towards&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: the people, the flaneurs, all impossibly cool, walking with their chin up like they all own the streets, with no sense of awareness for their fundamental stupidity in posing this way because if everyone pretends to be cooler than most than who&amp;#8217;s left to be&amp;nbsp;impressed?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these photos were taken with a Fuji X-Pro1 and one of the two lenses that I have, a 50mm and a 28mm-equivalent. You can read more on the camera &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2017-02-02-late-review-of-the-fuji-x-pro1.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I have struggled a lot on the decision of how to best render these images. I made them in color originally but decided to go mostly (not entirely) black and white, which is a bit against my instinct and also the judgement of somebody else that has a natural good taste for imagery. I have made two stacks of 10x15cm prints, one stack is color the other is black and white. I still don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s best.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:camera" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;portrait&amp;nbsp;photographers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they really that good? As Bill and Jefferey often say &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;on their show&lt;/a&gt;, how hard can it be to take a good photograph of George Clooney or some beautiful&amp;nbsp;model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I think that a good photographer needs to be able to make art with every subject. And I would extend my critique also to those that are on the other side of the spectrum, for example Bruce Gilden and his &amp;#8220;Faces&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; portraits of ugly people (or just people, made ugly on purpose by careful use of unflattering technique and make-up). When you have exceptional subjects, how hard can it be to take good&amp;nbsp;photos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare this to the art of somebody creating vivid, interesting, poetic images out of the normal everyday life or capturing tiny specks of interestingness from a juxtaposition of sand grains over a floating leaf in the small pond or something crazy like that. Isn&amp;#8217;t this the pinnacle of&amp;nbsp;creativity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;printing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been almost 3 years since I bought my printer&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;ve learnt is that the images we love to look at on a bright, calibrated, light-emitting monitor are quite different from their printed versions, almost like distant&amp;nbsp;cousins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating paper copies of your own photographs, having the possibility to refine the output in successive incremental
adjustments, forced me to understand first of all how different the two media are, i.e. screen and paper. And obviously
we all know this in theory &amp;#8212; but believe me, the result is quite different when you actually experience it by&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s also different from getting the prints done for you by somebody else, e.g. in a lab, because no matter how
close you are to the lab or how convenient this is, there is no way that you could really play with tiny adjustments if you&amp;#8217;re subcontracting the printing to somebody else, even if this is a &amp;#8220;master printer&amp;#8221;. Imagine you do only a a few touches of dodging or a slight modification of your curves &amp;#8212; this may well be all you need to get that final good rendition of your original vision, the image you had in mind when you first saw it during the shoot. Doing this with somebody else? Photography is way too subjective for that. Get your own opinion and ideas sorted out&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual process of getting prints done, compare them to what yo see on the screen, is incredibly frustrating but
rewarding at the same time. it&amp;#8217;s frustrating because no matter how good is your calibration procedure you will never see
the same colors; I believe it&amp;#8217;s also because a print, you have to look at it under good ambient lighting conditions, for
example under the good natured, diffused light that comes from a large window during a midsummer afternoon. And your
computer will be invariably in a much dimmer environment because that&amp;#8217;s what happens if you&amp;#8217;re fastidious  and want to
minimize glares and reflections on your&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a while a new sense of realizations kicks in and you understand how the printed photograph and the adjusted
raw file you have it on your monitor are really different objects; and despite your best intentions to optimize time and
economy of the whole business (the myth of a perfectly calibrated workflow that will allow the photographer to spit out
prints exactly similar to the screen) you start to realize that susseeive iterative adjustmts are needed to get what you
want.  And at the end it is quite possible that you end up with two final versions: one for screen use the other for
real life&amp;nbsp;prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sense of reward now begins to mount as you realize there&amp;#8217;s also so many different kinds of paper, and how different
the same image looks when printed on matte paper or glossy&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also start to see flaws that I never saw on the screen, probably distracted by the intensity of the colors due to the
transmitted light; I was scrutinizing some of my  alentima candids and realize how much craft there was like if I was
looking at it for the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you really start to finally understand those books, where the subject matter is king and there is no visual
crutch to make the images stand out, to realize how painstaking it is to see a photographer&amp;#8217;s vision getting a smack
down from the intensity of the printed&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;what makes a photographer&amp;nbsp;freeze&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Months ago I read &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/15/photographs-not-taken-photographer-freeze"&gt;an interesting article found on The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, which was about the photographs &amp;#8220;not taken&amp;#8221;. And I don&amp;#8217;t know how my twisted mind made this connection, but I expanded my thoughts to include the issue of private photos and if it&amp;#8217;s right or wrong to share them with a community largely made by&amp;nbsp;strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have discussed already my &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/pages/365-valentina.html"&gt;365 project&lt;/a&gt; which was about following my little daughter&amp;#8217;s boring/exciting (like Schroedinger&amp;#8217;s cat, it depends on the observer) second year of life. So this was a private project, and sometimes I wondered about whether it was right or wrong to share these photographs&lt;sup id="fnref:sharing"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sharing"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They are all very intimate of course &amp;#8212; which doesn&amp;#8217;t mean naked infant or something but just that these are intimate moments in our family. The way I was doing things. with no other intention than to fill a book that I will give as a present to my daughter when she&amp;#8217;s older, did not stop or slow me down. If I had to take a photograph a day with the intention of showing it in public, I would have been be much more&amp;nbsp;hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is connected, at least in my twisted mind, to the ambivalence that many people have raised between experience and photography; you&amp;#8217;ve all heard the story about going places and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVOID&lt;/span&gt; taking photographs because otherwise you rely on your camera&amp;#8217;s memory instead of yours; or the greater issue of participating in something versus taking photographs of the&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting conversation with an online acquaintance which went on like&amp;nbsp;this::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[J]&lt;/strong&gt; Alessandro, I struggle with whether or not to share my intimate family photos, too. I think about how we might be watering down our private, personal interactions by sharing them with the world. Thanks for the link to The Guardian article. I tend to err on the side of protecting the sacred moments, putting the camera away, and being &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; the moment instead of recording it.&amp;nbsp;﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[A]&lt;/strong&gt;There must be more than just the two of us that put their heart into something and don&amp;#8217;t feel the social pressure to &amp;#8220;share it&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;however.﻿&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[J]&lt;/strong&gt; I think that the move towards publicizing everything is a powerful social force&amp;#8230;but I won&amp;#8217;t cave. ;-) I have hundreds of photos of my kids that will never be on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;. Ever. In fact, I go a step further and keep a lot of my work to myself just because I have an emotional connection to the photo. That might be too stingy of me, I&amp;#8217;m not sure. Have you ever heard of Vivian Maier? She didn&amp;#8217;t feel the need to show her stuff to&amp;nbsp;anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[A]&lt;/strong&gt; Yes I&amp;#8217;ve heard of Vivian Maier (who hasn&amp;#8217;t these days?), and I like her story, the way she was drawn to photography as a thing only for herself, with no desire to share with the world. I would not advocate the same attitude but it&amp;#8217;s important to know that not all photographs need to be instantly shared, and some are better left on its own for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;observational&amp;nbsp;photographer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone asks me, what kind of photographer are you, I don&amp;#8217;t have a good answer right&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a portrait photographer, not a sports or landscape or fashion photographer; I may be mislabelled as a street
photography kind-of-photographer, but I rarely do black and white which is the signature style to be called that, and
more importantly I don&amp;#8217;t go prowling the streets with the intent of photographing&amp;nbsp;strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am is an observational photographer; which may be the most stupid and pleonastic definition I could choose, because what is a photographer if not someone who primarily&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;observes&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that definition rings true to me, vaguely recalling the title of a book that I have in my&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire &amp;#8220;thought&amp;#8221; however sounds so hollow when compared to the much more &lt;a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/2013/06/roadkill/"&gt;interesting and entertaining essay&lt;/a&gt; that my personal blogging hero Egor has made around similar&amp;nbsp;themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sharing"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I ended up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; sharing my project, only a few bits here and there.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sharing" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;artist and&amp;nbsp;dioramas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this japanese &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/arts/design/hiroshi-sugimoto-at-the-american-museum-of-natural-history.html"&gt;Hiroshi Sugimoto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes photographs to dioramas in the Natural History museum in New York, and his rationale is that two representations of reality (number 1: the diorama; number 2, the camera) they cancel each other so that the result is a &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; image of the past being depicted in the&amp;nbsp;diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr. Sugimoto writes in [his&amp;nbsp;website](http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/diorama.html:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon first arriving in New York in 1974, I did the tourist thing. Eventually I visited the Natural History Museum, where I made a curious discovery: the stuffed animals positioned before painted backdrops looked utterly fake, yet by taking a quick peek with one eye closed [&amp;#8230;] suddenly they looked very&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what he does is basically takes photos of these dioramas like any other guy that visits the museum. Only, he does it better, because due to his artist&amp;#8217;s status, he&amp;#8217;s allowed to take tripod and assistants and all the time he&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an assistant, Hiroshi Sumiyama, got inside the curtains, dressed head-to-toe in solid black — a cheap Halloween ninja costume that everyone on the team, including Mr. Sugimoto, wore that day to eliminate the possibility of reflection. Holding up a black pole, he energetically waved a placard attached to the top of the pole during the length of the three-and-a-half-minute exposure, to “dodge” down the brightness of the clouds in a way that is usually done in the&amp;nbsp;darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, these diorama crap may be just a divertissement, made it on purpose to have guys like me go mental. Let&amp;#8217;s have a look at &lt;a href="http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/portfolio.html"&gt;his portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this is even worse than the&amp;nbsp;dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how come Mr. Sugimoto can call himself an &amp;#8220;artist&amp;#8221;? Well, that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many contemporary photographers, Mr. Sugimoto’s work grapples with questions of perception and photography’s claims to&amp;nbsp;truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty clear. While I take pictures of things I see in my daily life, of my family or friends sometimes, the artist asks himself deep (and vague) questions about&amp;#8230; perception, right. And the truth. Maybe even politics and religion. Taking photos of fucking&amp;nbsp;dioramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;the artist&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to see people that take photographs stop calling themselves &lt;em&gt;artists&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://geandypavon.net/?page_id=764"&gt;write this junk&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I treasure the power of revelation and completeness that images contain however I know this power is activated only at the threshold of&amp;nbsp;destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the effectiveness of an image is inscribed in its potential as a ruin. I am interested in revealing the conceptual strength of an image by turning it into a ruin. I have found in the classic media of painting as well as analog photography, the most effective way to perpetuate this&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have developed a series of works in which I use archival photographic material which I wrinkle, cut or fold to be used as a model for my paintings. The subject portrayed in each photograph allows me to travel from one genre to another, such as landscapes or portraits but always conceived from the perspective of a still life&amp;nbsp;painter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this guy maybe fears that someone would steal his precious words so the text is locked with some web-trick and you cannot copy and paste (you don&amp;#8217;t need to be Mr Robot to go look at the source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and find the text there, perfeclty prone to&amp;nbsp;copy-and-paste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this other&amp;nbsp;statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and multimedia&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Andy Warhol, new tensions are synthesised from both opaque and transparent&amp;nbsp;textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships. What starts out as hope soon becomes debased into a manifesto of futility, leaving only a sense of decadence and the inevitability of a new&amp;nbsp;understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As wavering replicas become distorted through diligent and academic practice, the viewer is left with a tribute to the darkness of our&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes you puke this one too, right? Turns out, this is automated junk courtesy of &lt;a href="http://artybollocks.com/#abg_full"&gt;artybollocks
generator&lt;/a&gt;. It is rather similar to many more of these artist statement you can find&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think I made the first one up (I didn&amp;#8217;t, I also put the link), listen to these other artists saying their&amp;nbsp;thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://palazzodellaragionefotografia.it/exhibition/italia-inside-out-inside/"&gt;http://palazzodellaragionefotografia.it/exhibition/italia-inside-out-inside/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, none of this make&amp;nbsp;sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you get to the actual &amp;#8220;art&amp;#8221;, and things get tricky. Can I quote &lt;a href="http://photothunk.blogspot.no/"&gt;Andrew Molitor&lt;/a&gt;? Look at these piece of shit. I mean this&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carolinedouglasphotography.co.uk/colour.html"&gt;http://www.carolinedouglasphotography.co.uk/colour.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uncertainstates.com"&gt;http://www.uncertainstates.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I stumble in this guy &lt;a href="http://journal.hinius.net/"&gt;Hin Chua&lt;/a&gt;, I hear him talking at &lt;a href="http://lpvshow.com/episode-3-1-hin-chua/"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPV&lt;/span&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; and he is rather engaging and interesting, and good things are said during the course of the show about his photos &amp;#8212; I mean the guy was even featured on &lt;a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/ephemeral-paradise-in-medium-format/?_r=1"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times Lens blog&lt;/a&gt;. So I&amp;#8217;m hesitant to call him a fraude and I start questioning me&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hinius.net/after-the-fall/"&gt;After the&amp;nbsp;fall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hinius.net/they-called-me-a-corporate-whore/"&gt;They called me a corporate&amp;nbsp;whore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this other &lt;a href="http://www.noelcamardo.com/Giant/1/caption"&gt;Noel Camardo&lt;/a&gt; too. He also makes me&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;related&amp;nbsp;pieces&lt;/h3&gt;
