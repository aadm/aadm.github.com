&lt;p&gt;Well it seems I have successfully ported my blog to&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there were a few long nights to do that but to be honest it was easier than&amp;nbsp;Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now the site will remain active on this secondary page, &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/the-liquid-steppe"&gt;The Liquid Steppe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still love bikes, especially mountain&amp;nbsp;bikes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still love motorbikes but somehow I don&amp;#8217;t see myself actually getting one&amp;nbsp;soon;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have changed my mind about those ugly&amp;nbsp;29ers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now have two mountain bikes, a 29er rigid hardtail bought second hand for very little money, and a brand new, very special Nicolai which I&amp;#8217;m gonna talk about it&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/23835975486/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/23835975486_874eb7ca0c_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story goes like that: after having my Transition Covert stolen way back in 2013, my friend Phil (from T-P 2010) convinced me to get a bike which I would have never thought of buying; a short-travel, full-suspension Norco with 29&amp;#8221; wheels. The price was very reasonable too, which I think was essential for my&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had this Norco since March 2014, and rode it everywhere; from banal cross-country loops to gnarly rocky trails in Finale Ligure (my preferred training playground). It was a blast, and since then I have had only positive thoughts for big wheelers. After a while, I began pushing the bike to its limits and I was considering to upgrade fork and shock but it sounded like one of those stupid upgrades where I had to spend more than what the bike was worth to have truly significant&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year had gone by, and by May 2015 I had to momentarily put mountain bikes aside as Giulia and I started considering the opportunity to move to Norway for work;  we thought it was good for our daughter Valentina as well as for ourselves (fresh air and all&amp;nbsp;that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said I had to put biking aside but really &amp;#8212; it was only for a few hours that I put biking aside in my thoughts, and next thing that popped up in my mind was that I had a perfect excuse to sell the Norco and get a new&amp;nbsp;bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I was, slowly getting acquainted with the idea that a custom German bike with crazy geometry and an even crazier name could be the right one for me. Over the summer the plan began to take shape, and on the second weekend of October I boarded a plane to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; where I was picked up by Phil, driven to his house where a brand new Nicolai Mojo Geometron was waiting for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that &amp;#8220;Geometron&amp;#8221; sounds like something straight out of a comic book, but there is nothing remotely cartoonish about these bikes. Chris Porter, geometry and suspension guru, owner of Mojo Suspension (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Fox distributor), has been modifying and then building bikes in collaboration with the German frame builder Nicolai for quite some time now, in relentless pursuit of his ideal of perfect bike geometry. After lots of one-off frames that he personally tested against the clock (he&amp;#8217;s raced &lt;a href="https://www.rootsandrain.com/rider12486/chris-porter/results/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DH&lt;/span&gt; and enduro&lt;/a&gt; so he knows one or two things about speed), he finally settled during 2015 on some numbers, and had Nicolai build the first batch of 25 frames, all matte black, sized Long, Longer and Longest (that must give you an idea for the most striking feature of these&amp;nbsp;bikes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little aside: my bike must be #24 of the original&amp;nbsp;twenty-five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These frames are matched to custom tuned Fox fork and shocks, and that is really where the magic comes from, in matching the radical geometry of these bikes with finely tuned suspensions. I have an intuitive grasp of engineering concepts so I can appreciate the ideas and guiding principles behind these bikes; however, I&amp;#8217;m doing you a favor by redirecting to the reviews that have been published&lt;sup id="fnref:reviews"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reviews" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; I would also recommend to read Chris&amp;#8217;s thoughts&lt;sup id="fnref:chris-writing"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:chris-writing" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/23233638354/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/23233638354_c375515cb5_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again it was Phil who was instrumental in my decision; he has been following a similar path to Chris in the past 3 years, striving to build his definitive mountain bike. When Phil first tested a Geometron he was simply struck by how good this bike was, quickly changed his mind about going the solo route (i.e., building bikes with custom geometry based on &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; own ideas) and was among the first to buy a frame from Mojo. He then told me that this bike, a 160-170mm travel bike with 62 degrees head angle, was quite simply an excellent cross-country&lt;sup id="fnref:xc"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xc" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; bike in addition to being an incredibly effective&amp;nbsp;trail-smashing-monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One things I have learnt about Phil over the years, is that he is the most consistent and reliable source for everything about bikes. Which is to say, he not only is able to explain logically why things work, but also that his mindset regarding bikes and mountain biking in general is pretty much in tune with my own taste; I still have in mind how good was his previous custom Nicolai when I rode it in Finale Ligure, I trusted his recommendation to try the Norco 29&amp;#8221; and thanks to him I have had an excellent (and cheap) ride that has been an enormous source of fun in the past year and a&amp;nbsp;half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he said that the Geometron was &amp;#8220;the one&amp;#8221;, I really thought on it for what must have been ten minutes max, then placed the order blind, without even testing the&amp;nbsp;bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I was, flying Norwegian Airlines to Manchester where Phil came to pick me up. I hadn&amp;#8217;t been riding for a while so I was eager but also a little anxious to get back riding a bike on the trails. Luckily Phil was able to spice up the trip back to Hinckley where he lives, by entering a roundabout way too fast; the rear-wheel slide was huge but his counter-steer was fast enough to avoid making a mess. And here I was thinking that modern Porsches were tamed animals compared to the tail-happy beasts of the 70s and&amp;nbsp;80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/23494113389/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/664/23494113389_d35fa007f1_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then spent the entire weekend at the Forest of Dean, where I once again rediscovered something that I somehow forgot in all these years&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-roadracing"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-roadracing" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; that is, a certain friendly energetic vibe you can feel where there&amp;#8217;s other people that enjoy simple things like riding a bike downhill. And that is a vibe that I rarely experience back home in Italy; maybe it&amp;#8217;s a certain english way to approach this kind of activity that I like &amp;#8212; t-shirts as opposed to pro-racer jerseys, mums and kids and girls with all level of skills riding for fun as opposed to mostly men looking with utter disdain at the &amp;#8220;others&amp;#8221;. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just me, enjoying the anonimity of riding in a place where surely I won&amp;#8217;t ride ever&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when we arrived at the &lt;a href="http://www.pinkbike.com/news/cannop-trail-centre-in-the-forest-of-dean-2015.html"&gt;Cannop trail centre&lt;/a&gt; car park it was unexpectedly sunny (remember: it was November, and it was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;!) and Chris Porter was there waiting for us. He checked the sag on my bike, watched me for a couple of minutes then we were off for the short climb to the start of the downhill trails. It was all a bit greasy and wet but nothing too sketchy; it was however &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sketchy the day after when we left the trail centre and we adventured through some trails that were Chris&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/23493992849"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5692/23493992849_3eb7536dfb_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;caption a.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- You know those trails where he stops at the top, declares "today I'm doing it in 2 minutes 30 secs", then starts his handlebar-mounted stopwatch  and blasts down; you get down to the bottom in a time which considerably more than 2'30" and he matter-of-factly tells you "what did I say? two-thirty? Almost..." and he shows on the stopwatch 2'32". --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike felt very strange in the car park; it was definitely not a normal bike, there was almost a disconnect between handlebars and front wheel that left me a bit puzzled (it still does a few months in! especially after riding every day my very twitchy rigid 29er). But once you leave the flats and start climbing all fears of vagueness disappear; strange but true, even with this absurdly slack head angle, the bike felt good at climbing &amp;#8212; and at the end of the first day it also felt very very good at&amp;nbsp;descending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- The point is that the bike does feel a bit off only on flat; as soon as you point up or down then it starts to make sense and makes you feel like a hero. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climbing part is actually very interesting; yes the Geometron is clearly not a sprinty carbon bike (remember the 180mm Fox up front, the massive aluminum tubes, etc); however being so long and slack it really does help when climbing steep, technical trails (think switchbacks and loose gravel). You ever felt the need to move your body around just to keep the front wheel down and simultaneously loading the rear wheel so it doesn&amp;#8217;t lose traction? You know that exhausting game where you are on the tip of the saddle, just hovering on it trying to keep the rear tyre loaded while pushing down on the bars? Well on this bike you kind of rely on the massive wheelbase and the incredible traction so you can just hammer on the pedals without too much thinking (or moving&amp;nbsp;around).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about the good part, the going downhill part? Well this is where things gets interesting, but if you have read pinkbike&amp;#8217;s review and the asinine comments left by too many keyboard warriors, you may understand how hesitant I am to tell you this story. There&amp;#8217;s also the part of me that keeps saying that I am not too qualified to talk about it, being the average rider that I am &amp;#8212; but hey I did invest a considerable amount of money on this bike (plus this one you&amp;#8217;re reading is my blog), so a little something needs to be&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say right now that despite having had this bike from last October I haven&amp;#8217;t still used it on my favourite trails, nor I have used it too much, period; reason is that here in Norway where I&amp;#8217;m living at the moment there aren&amp;#8217;t big mountains (as in Italy) or a good system of trails (as in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;). So I am still waiting to hop on a plane when spring comes and spend a good three-four days of riding somewhere where the trails are technical, long and possibly rocky and dry. That&amp;#8217;s when I will finally get the hang of this bike. So far, I have had only glimpses of how glorious the riding will be &amp;#8212; but those glimpses have been enough to keep my head spinning with&amp;nbsp;anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that first weekend I just got comfortable on the bike and I could sense the enormous amount of traction despite the terrain conditions that were, well can we say &amp;#8220;british&amp;#8221;? On the second day, instead of doing again laps on safe confines of the Cannop trail centre we followed Chris on &amp;#8220;his&amp;#8221; trails (at the beginning of another one he also casually mentioned that that was one of Steve Jones&amp;#8217;&lt;sup id="fnref:steve-jones"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:steve-jones" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; favourites); those were raw and technical, something I would enjoy only after weeks of scouting and repeated runs. Being able to ride them in conditions that even my Brits companions kept on defining crazy muddy is a testimony of the confidence that the Geometron&amp;nbsp;instils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/e35/12120326_910125112388962_499836949_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://scontent-ams3-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e35/12142338_1685469915031427_289908114_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really interesting is to realize how little the length of the bike impacts on the enjoyment on the trails; yes, even tight, switch-backy trails where every keyboard warrior would surely object that this bike can&amp;#8217;t possibly turn at all. Guess what &amp;#8212; it does! And it does by forcing you to adopt the right position and technique, by loading the front tyre always and everywhere, and when you do so the whole action is so rewarding that you really feel like a&amp;nbsp;hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once again, I will need to spend more time on the bike. However, a word of warning: if things go like they should, I will never write something else on my Nicolai Mojo Geometron. I was digging in my archives and realized that once I start enjoying a bike (e.g., Ducati 999S, Norco Shinobi) I never write anything about it because I&amp;#8217;m too busy riding the&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the years 2000-2004 I used to race my motorbike in local races (Club and Superclub) at circuits like Mallory Park, Cadwell Park, Snetterton. It was glorious, disappointing, humbling and exciting at the same time. And what I remember very vividly is the feeling of being a bit lost in the paddock, alone with my rented van and my road-legal Honda 600; there were entire families (clans!) supporting with equal passion boys who wanted to be champions as well as older men racing for fun. I could see little fuss, little money, but shitloads of passion &amp;#8212; and that was a good thing that I still hold dear in my heart.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-roadracing" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But stuff happened, and I will write another time about our recent move to Norway. This is just a brief post to mark the day that I have finally uploaded to github the latest iteration of my Jekyll&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fancy a bit of history, in 2012 I &lt;a href="2012-07-12-moving-to-github.html"&gt;moved my blog to github &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, then in 2013 I &lt;a href="2013-11-09-blog-renewal.html"&gt;made some radical changes to the layout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a second &amp;#8212; the title says &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;latest&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s not a typo; in fact I am playing right now with &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; which is yet another static site generator like Jekyll (current platform I&amp;#8217;m using). So there is a chance that right now I will lose some more sleep trying to make the transition to&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sane part of me is obviously saying to just let it go and concentrate on reviewing the twenty or so drafts I have, to actually write the other things I have in mind, and what about the hundreds of photo series I want to polish and publish? Perhaps the sane part of me is too&amp;nbsp;quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is what this website looked&amp;nbsp;yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;

It has not seen much action&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I started taking photos when I was sixteen or seventeen with a Yashica &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX3&lt;/span&gt;, and I don&amp;#8217;t really have any kind of nostalgia for those times when I had to wait days before realizing I missed a certain shot, or that I focused on that insignificant detail &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; my&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this Nikon is a lovely piece of metal, so I said to myself, let&amp;#8217;s put some film in and give it a go. After a few half-assed attempts using expired film, I loaded a roll of Fuji Acros 100 back in September 2014, shot with it on a couple of occasions, and a couple of weeks ago I finally got it&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And boy, was I surprised to see the results. Was I excited to look at these pictures that I almost forgot having&amp;nbsp;taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never going back to film. And I am not going to declare that film has some mythical&amp;nbsp;quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you, I may start bringing this old Nikon along more often from now&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it will be loaded with this Acros 100 black and&amp;nbsp;white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sort of competition there is no subjectivity; if you go faster than everybody else, you finish first. If you are slow, if you make mistakes, you finish last&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-winning"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-winning" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have always been a middle-pack kind of guy. But I still enjoyed racing even after finishing behind elders and youngsters, males or females &amp;#8212; if somebody is faster than me that is pretty darn objective and I respect&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographic competitions on the other hand &amp;#8212; they are not for me. I mean how can you judge in any sort of objective way photographs? I&amp;#8217;m not even able to judge my own photos and decide which one gets one star or five. One day picture &amp;#8220;A&amp;#8221; looks amazing, the next day I wish I&amp;#8217;ve never taken&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of having somebody else judging photographs and decide which one&amp;#8217;s a winner? That&amp;#8217;s the worst idea ever. But there is an entire ecosystem around photoclubs and amateurs, and I have discovered that many people get excited by this, and they seem to make photographs only to &amp;#8220;win&amp;#8221; something (be it an award, or social networks&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;likes&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, last year I decided to take part to the contest organized by my local photoclub. Partly out of respect for the group, partly because I believe in the need to feed the life of these clubs otherwise they would be dead and people would stay home watching&amp;nbsp;football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to show here the photographs I have chosen for the 2013-2014 contest. The idea behind last year&amp;#8217;s contest was to show small &amp;#8216;portfolios&amp;#8217; (3 pictures each) following certain themes assigned&amp;nbsp;beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to use prints was certainly good, since the current trend in the photographic world is to avoid printing altogether. And there is so much you can discover of your own photos after you print them out; some that have hit you with their sparkles and beautiful colours may look just dull and missing a strong subject when they are transferred from the transmissive lighting of a screen to the reflective lighting of a&amp;nbsp;print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how did I fare? Not very good: all of my portfolios were pretty much ignored. And did I happen to respect or admire the photos of the many other photographers who ended up above me? Or simply understand why they were collectively judged &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221; than mine? I&amp;#8217;m afraid I did&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens now is that I am back on the same ship, awaiting for even more frustration. And yes, last Thursday there was the first instalment of the 2014-2015 contest, and I placed &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/15899781815"&gt;second from last&lt;/a&gt;, which is my worst result ever. But that&amp;#8217;s a story for another&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, enjoy my very unsuccessful 2013-2014&amp;nbsp;photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;i still like some of&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particulary like the &amp;#8220;traveling&amp;#8221; and the &amp;#8220;from above&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was shot one morning at the Stazione Centrale in Milano, and I had to find these images in just an hour or so while wife and daughter were waiting for me at a cafè nearby. What I was looking for was images to convey the sense of&amp;nbsp;traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second series was also shot on purpose and I intentionally wanted to get as far as possible from the conventional interpretation of the theme (e.g.: shooting high from a building, from an airplane, etc). But this one was even less well received than the&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snow and eating were just collected from my archive because I simply could not find the time to go out and&amp;nbsp;shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one, about heavy duty workers, was challenging because I could not find a good idea and I simply walked right into this construction site, all fenced up, and had to find images that would fit the them. I like the pictures, not sure about how strong is their presence as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Padre e figlia, ottobre 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A maggio scorso ho assistito a una presentazione di &lt;a href="http://www.photogalleria.it/index.php?autore=francesco%20cito"&gt;Francesco Cito&lt;/a&gt;, noto fotografo italiano. Tra i vari progetti mostrati c&amp;#8217;era anche &amp;#8220;Coma&amp;#8221;, in cui raccontava, attraverso immagini piatte e struggenti, la normalità che circonda dei ragazzi entrati in coma&amp;nbsp;irreversibile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E la normalità sarebbe quella di parenti e amici che festeggiano i compleanni, cambiano e puliscono i loro ragazzoni trentenni regrediti a un livello&amp;nbsp;pre-infantile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&amp;#8217;interpretazione di Cito sarebbe che: le mamme, loro sono anche contente di pulire i pannolini e cambiare i loro ragazzoni, perché è come un riavvicinarsi a quei momenti felici dell&amp;#8217;infanzia in cui il bambino ha un bisogno morboso di loro. I papà invece si allontanano; e il motivo per cui lo fanno è che i papà (tutti quanti eh, nessuno escluso) riversano sui figli idee e aspirazioni mancate e quindi vedono i figli come proseguimento della loro esistenza o realizzatori di sogni mancati. E quando il figlio diventa un vegetale allora se ne disinteressano, e si&amp;nbsp;allontanano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora, io apprezzo e ammiro quei fotografi che costruiscono una narrativa attorno alle loro fotografie; quelli che cercano di espandere il potere di una sequenza di foto opportunamente scelte con la parola scritta (o&amp;nbsp;narrata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma a volte sarebbe meglio che non lo facessero, se poi arrivano a conclusioni rozze come questa, tagliate con l&amp;#8217;accetta, vagamente offensive e irrispettose di una triste condizione in cui è difficile&amp;nbsp;immedesimarsi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cito insomma dà per scontata una motivazione egoistica alla base dell&amp;#8217;esperienza paterna, probabilmente influenzato da come la sua vita si è svolta. Ma poi estende con arroganza questa sua conclusione facendola diventare una verità&amp;nbsp;universale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fosse stato un cretino qualsiasi a dire queste cose, ci sarei passato su senza pensarci troppo. E invece è stata questa persona i cui progetti fotografici sono degli esempi di stile, coraggio e sensibilità artistica a quintali; un vero peccato e una mezza&amp;nbsp;delusione.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="photo"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>weekly snaps 17</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2013-07-31-weekly-snaps-17.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-31T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2013-07-31:2013-07-31-weekly-snaps-17.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a thin line that connects these photographs, but I also put a couple that I just enjoyed as they were (if only to stay true to my original intention of using these posts to display photographs that do not fit into a larger&amp;nbsp;story).&lt;/p&gt;
