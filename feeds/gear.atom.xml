For&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Leica: the stupidly expensive cameras that are only bought by trustafarians and rich asians. The kind of camera that is more likely to be kept in a closet or worn like a piece of jewellery than actually&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway they are indeed &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; and I like their heft and the heavy metal they&amp;#8217;re built with. But I would have never considered one for real if I had not played with the original Monochrom; that really changed something, the simple pleasure of using and holding this rather large, deceiptively simple and &amp;#8220;dense&amp;#8221; camera changed somehow my perception. I will be honest and declare it right now that none of this matters when it comes to Photography; but I&amp;#8217;m talking about something else here, I&amp;#8217;m talking about very elementary pleasures that are tangentially related to the actual making of photographs; the same pleasure that I get from using bycicles or a Faber-Castell pencil for&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I went on and looked for older digital models like the M8.2 and the M9, and for cheap lenses that I could afford; however after a cursory search on the internet my excitement quickly faded off and I realized that I&amp;#8217;d better get something&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24667920971" title="20151011_OMD0322.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24667920971_15e0438a86_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about my D600 which was not going anywhere being so incredibly good at everything: comfortable and fast to use; incredible sensor output even now 3 years down the line &amp;#8212; regardless of all the shit and dust you can collect, it&amp;#8217;s still basically the same heart that powers the now much acclaimed&amp;nbsp;D750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the D600 was here to stay; what I was missing was probably a smaller camera that I could carry anywhere without second thoughts; a camera that I could throw in the backpack when I go biking somewhere or carry on my daily work commutes, something that I could have always with me to record snapshots&lt;sup id="fnref:snapshots"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:snapshots" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that sometimes change the balance of your&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24735187396" title="20151012_OMD0332.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1553/24735187396_248d3a2202_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And mind you, it&amp;#8217;s not that I am big-heavy-zoom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; user; on the contrary, the lenses that I use the most with my D600 are an old 50mm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; f/1.4 and a manual focus 28mm f/2.8. I am used to bring the Nikon with me everywhere but in actual fact, sometimes it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; indeed a bit heavy and cumbersome (I remember hiking with my little daughter in the backpack and the Nikon stuffed between sandwiches and&amp;nbsp;nappies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I could do with a small camera. And I still had good memories of &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that was lying unused somewhere. There were these small compact cameras with big sensor that were enticing (Nikon Coolpix A and Ricoh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GR&lt;/span&gt;) but their lenses were fixed 28mm-equivalent and I simply don&amp;#8217;t see that wide; if I only have one lens that&amp;#8217;s gonna be a 50mm or something like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24735192056" title="20151013_OMD0350.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1662/24735192056_10b00d9d19_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did an experiment; revived my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;, bought a new lens (a 50mm equivalent, obviously &amp;#8212; the Olympus 25mm f/1.8) and used it to document &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/pages/northbound.html"&gt;my trip up north&lt;/a&gt; at the end of August last year. And guess what &amp;#8212; I had fun with it, and at the end I got the proper images to tell my story; not particularly rich or detailed but good honest little black and white&amp;nbsp;snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was undeniable proof that I was on the right track; I kept my 25mm and completed the upgrade buying the &amp;#8216;old&amp;#8217; Olympus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM10&lt;/span&gt; (its second iteration had just been announced) and the 45mm f/1.8 taking advantage of the end-of-life discounts that Olympus Europe was having over the summer. The crazy thing is that I paid the body only 350 euros. With the same money I could probably have bought a knob of a Leica. And with 2.5 Leica-knobs I now had a tiny system covering all my most used focal lengths (I still had the old Panasonic 14mm &amp;#8212; a 28mm-equivalent &amp;#8212; from my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24643653612" title="20151017_OMD0564.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1465/24643653612_613074d553_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using the little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMD&lt;/span&gt; quite a lot since I&amp;#8217;m here in Norway. The 16 megapixels sensor may be rather old, and the stabilizer is only 3-way as compared to 5 of the newer Olympus, and the electronic viewfinder is just decent, but good enough to let you take photos. Pricewise the camera is a star and I would recommend it to everyone that knows his way around cameras (beginners should look somewhere else; too many things you can customize in here &amp;#8212; a beginner should be given this camera with most of the litte buttons taped over or glued to the case and at least one knob detached and stored away in a&amp;nbsp;closet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some blogger I now refrain from quoting once said that we have past reached the point of sufficiency with cameras. My D600 is 3 or 4 years old and its resolution, speed, transparency are so good that nothing could stop me from using it for many more years except lust for a shiny new gadget (or general&amp;nbsp;boredom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this Olympus is like a little D600&lt;sup id="fnref:sensor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sensor" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; the raw photographs are very malleable, just like the D600 &amp;#8212; well maybe a little less: a little less potential to recover the deep blacks or the highlights, a little less clean at high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, a little less comfortable and secure when holding it with one hand. But you know, &amp;#8220;a little less&amp;#8221; than a D600 it means that it is still astonishingly&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24667832401" title="20151009_OMD0083.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24667832401_cbd614cf49_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly it is a big step above the old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;. With that camera I could feel the pain whenever the light was not 100-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; conditions. And composing with the rear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; was at times very irritating. And the stabilization system? I honestly did not think it was that big of a deal &amp;#8212; after all I have been shooting traditional (D)SLRs with no such helps for a long time. But these little cameras are inherently unbalanced due to their low weight so it&amp;#8217;s almost easier to keep steady a largish &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; body with a normal lens attached than one of them tiny&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small flaws I have found are probably rather known; like you should know before even approaching one of these mirrorless cameras that they will exhaust the battery pretty quickly. So you have to have extra batteries (but perfectly good chinese knock-offs are available on amazon for two or three chocolate money). And the (lack of) grip compared to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; can be unnerving so you gotta use a strap (on my D600 most of the times I don&amp;#8217;t). Actually there is a tiny thumb-rest on the Olympus that it&amp;#8217;s really a brilliant idea and makes it slightly easier to hold (I know for example that users of the much more expensive Fuji X-Pro have to buy a second-party&amp;nbsp;thumb-rest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24761438715" title="20151016_OMD0452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1701/24761438715_81a60e475c_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the lenses I have are also very very good; the 25mm and the 45mm. The Panasonic 14mm f/2.5 on the other hand is a piece of shit but it&amp;#8217;s so tiny and cheap that it&amp;#8217;s difficult not to recommend over the more expensive options out there (also remember that I don&amp;#8217;t care too much about wide&amp;nbsp;angles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a flaw maybe it&amp;#8217;s this, and it&amp;#8217;s related to something I wrote at the beginning: there&amp;#8217;s too much electronics inside and this somehow bothers me. It bothers me that the shutter sound is too subdued; that there is a constant whirring sound when you switch it on (the stabilization system), and despite being surprisingly well built, it most definitely is not a solid piece of metal like a Leica. It is also a fraction of a second too slow in almost everything (switching from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVF&lt;/span&gt; to rear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;; activating the menus; locking the focus; etc.); nothing truly disturbing and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the most expensive siblings (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM1&lt;/span&gt;) would certainly be faster but all of these things they add up and make for a not entirely compelling&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know very well, I&amp;#8217;m making silly comparisons (a 350 euros Olympus compared to a Leica? and what do you mean by &amp;#8220;compelling&amp;#8221; anyway?). All I will say is that (confusingly enough) this is a fantastic little camera, it gives you the possibility to take great photos (which should be all that you need to worry about), but there is something that holds me from declaring it the best camera ever. I hope you weren&amp;#8217;t looking for a list of pros and cons and some &amp;#8220;final words&amp;#8221; on this camera; I think you can find them easily enough on other&amp;nbsp;websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For some more photos taken with this little camera point your browser to &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/albums/72157664053048131"&gt;this flickr album&lt;/a&gt;. All the photos included here are clickable too and will take you to their own flickr page where you can read geeky stuff like lens, aperture and shutter speeds (but don&amp;#8217;t do that because it&amp;#8217;s not really&amp;nbsp;important).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:snapshots"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approximate translation in italian of snapshots is &amp;#8220;istantanee&amp;#8221;, which means something that occurs at one moment and the next one is gone. Rather appropriate description for most of the photos I take.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:snapshots" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sensor"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do share the same father after all; both cameras have Sony sensor and I can see how similar they are when their raw files are subjected to heavy treatment.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sensor" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#8217;s the impression you have from reading the rants in the dpreview forums, well it&amp;#8217;s wrong. And you should stop reading those forums (I know, I should too! It&amp;#8217;s just that sometimes something really clever comes up like the &lt;a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3377109"&gt;Dot Tune workflow to do &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tuning on Nikon DSLRs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24412301519" title="20130302_AA00692.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1680/24412301519_a5151833a8_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s actually a bit larger, not uncomfortably so however; it&amp;#8217;s still sized very reasonably, but it&amp;#8217;s more squat than the D7000 probably because it needs to accomodate that wonderfully large viewfinder. The overall feel is of a tougher and more grown-up camera than the D7000 (and the D7000 in my opinion is a perfectly mature body, a perfect compromise between the small and plasticky D3xxx/D5xxx and the hulky&amp;nbsp;D700/D3/D4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the new multi-controller, it feels more snappy and clickable than on the D7000; I don&amp;#8217;t understand the necessity to have a lever switch that commutes between camera and movie-mode liveview but maybe someday I&amp;#8217;ll get it. And yes, the location of the buttons is somewhat different (like the zoom in and out buttons are now reversed &amp;#8212; but in line with newer cameras such as D800 and D7100) and there&amp;#8217;s other little differences but really? Are you such a monkey that you cannot deal with the changes of a few buttons? That&amp;#8217;s the sort of criticism that I read on dpreview forums, and I just can&amp;#8217;t stand them. To me it seems on the other hand that Nikon is able to keep an incredible &amp;#8216;family feeling&amp;#8217; throughout the endless iterations from the D100 down to this new&amp;nbsp;D600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can easily wade through the very comprehensive menu system without even looking at the manual, and change the most important parameters (shooting mode, aperture, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, quality, etc.) without even thinking that this is a brand new camera. What&amp;#8217;s important is that when you hold the camera your fingers fall exactly where they are used to; the shutter button, the way it handles, it&amp;#8217;s all&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite my now subdued love for the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-12-17-fuji-test-day.html"&gt;new Fuji cameras&lt;/a&gt; and their wonderful simplicity (little knobs, real aperture ring) I still feel that the shape of a larger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; is ergonomically perfect. The little rangefinder-style cameras on the other hand (such as the Fuji &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XE&lt;/span&gt;-1 which I have tried, and loved, and wanted to buy) they don&amp;#8217;t feel that right to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;lunchtime break, a few snaps&amp;nbsp;later&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24151775454" title="20130223_AA00168.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1514/24151775454_e78580ac25_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy? It seems to me that D600+50mm f/1.8D gives a me a brand new experience compared to the D7000+35mm f/1.8G; while they should be the same, really. Is it maybe due to the bright and large viewfinder where you can see so much more? Really unexpected and fantastic discovery this one; I was walking in my rather bleak suburban setting under a light snowfall and I found myself so excited to have this &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; lens to use. Yes, my old 50mm suddenly becomes a novelty, how&amp;#8217;s that for renovating your photographic eye without punching a hole in your (already depressed)&amp;nbsp;wallet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, you know how I made this purchase possible? By getting rid of two or three of my old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; lenses: the little 35mm f/1.G (sad to see this little fella go!), a really good Tokina 12-24 f/4 and the cheapo-uberplastik Nikon 55-200 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; f/4-5.6; the idea was that I could replace the 35mm f/1.8 (surely my most used lens on the D7000) with one of my three 50mm&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-50mm"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-50mm" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the 12-24 with an old 18mm f/3.5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-18mm"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-18mm" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I did have a longer lens, the wonderful 85mm f/1.8G, and then I have realized I really don&amp;#8217;t need anything else since I don&amp;#8217;t do sports or birds or stalking. So off they go these &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; lenses (less is more, right?) and here it comes a full frame camera which hopefully will keep me satisfied and engaged for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;D600 after a&amp;nbsp;D7000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it right to replace the D7000 with a D600? Well the D7000 remains a true little gem, considering how cheap it now goes in the second hand market (I sold mine for 550 euros), and its image quality and responsiveness and build quality is really something that will keep its owners happy for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24153439234/" title="20130225_AA00346.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1567/24153439234_7572e54216_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s one thing I didn&amp;#8217;t like about the D7000, it would be the good deal of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine-tuning required before getting really sharp pictures; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it was my particular camera&amp;#8217;s problem &amp;#8212; I can&amp;#8217;t really say &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T buy a D7000 because it has a fine-tuning issue&amp;#8221;. Very likely you won&amp;#8217;t have this problem &amp;#8212; but you may well have another! If you want a a truly foolproof camera, built and quality-checked to higher standards you probably need to be ready to spend lots of money to get something like a&amp;nbsp;D4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#8217;s tangential to the main issue, which is about the D600 and whether or not is a reasonable upgrade to make after a D7000. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that this D600 will not instantly make me a better photographer. I&amp;#8217;m also pretty sure that my D7000 would have allowed me to grow in my photographic education with no real restraints. So if somebody is looking at some excuse to justify the move to a rather expensive full frame camera (because in my world 1600-2000 euros is a lot of money), well I can&amp;#8217;t give you&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are really good, I mean technically good, then you will find exciting the &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/11/27/d600-500-shots/"&gt;incredible highlights&lt;/a&gt; that you can &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/02/17/highlight-fetishist/"&gt;recover from the D600&lt;/a&gt;; I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re  able to use these capabilities for creative purposes then yes, there&amp;#8217;s the  justification to replace you D7000 with a D600. I&amp;#8217;m not like that and the kind of photographs that I like to take are pretty much well served by any modern&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t even feel like I have a gear acquisition syndrome, in fact (despite what my wife says) I am pretty balanced in my purchases and I only tend to buy new stuff once I feel like I have exhausted the possibilities that a certain piece of gear gives me&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-outgrow"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-outgrow" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So yes, the D600 is surely giving me cleaner pictures at high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, and it has twenty-four megapixels as opposed to sixteen, increased depth-of-field control due to the larger sensor alright &amp;#8212; but listen to me, these things have meant very little for me when I decided to&amp;nbsp;upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of economy, that is I was able to do this with a relative modest sum, and why the hell not. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a matter of aesthetics and nostalgia, that I liked the idea of using a 50mm and have a 50mm look, or maybe I liked the idea of looking through this larger and brighter viewfinder. Who knows, maybe I will need to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; this camera, see what I can do with that and come back here and write my thoughts, like I did for the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-09-21-thoughts-on-d7000.html"&gt;D7000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:nota-50mm"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right, three 50mm. I have had my trusty 50mm f/1.8D since the times of my first autofocus film camera (Nikon F70), then I have got from my father-in-law the 50mm f/1.4 and an old &lt;a href="http://www.djcphoto.com/index.php/nikkor-s-50mm-f1-4-non-ai-lens/"&gt;pre-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; f/1.4&lt;/a&gt; (the one with the sculpted focus ring which &amp;#8216;starred&amp;#8217; in Michelangelo Antonioni&amp;#8217;s Blow-Up).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-50mm" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-18mm"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lens that was lying unused in my father-in-law cabinet.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-18mm" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-outgrow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s always been true with bikes and motorbikes, for example. I really pushed hard my Monster, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBR600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2008-03-23-speedweek-2007-su-mondoducati.html"&gt;Multistrada&lt;/a&gt; before finally ending up on the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2008-10-20-999s-il-primo-giro.html"&gt;Ducati 999&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; and &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2009-08-27-speedweek-2009.html"&gt;outgrew&lt;/a&gt; this one too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-outgrow" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s time to write down some comments on this&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;where I come&amp;nbsp;from&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context first; I arrived at the Nikon D7000 from a long&amp;nbsp;apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a Yashica &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;-3 and its 50mm f/1.8, then I moved to a Nikon F70 (we&amp;#8217;re still in the ancient film era). After a few crappy compact digital cameras (and one less crappy than others, the Canon G5) I got my first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; (a Nikon D70s) which was excellent &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-08-19-my-next-camera.html"&gt;until it broke down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was always traveling and hiking and biking I wanted a smaller camera so I bought a &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-09-11-it-was-unintentional.html"&gt;Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt; that I &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;still have&lt;/a&gt; (and will keep for many more years to come; it&amp;#8217;s still much better than any compact camera and only marginally&amp;nbsp;larger).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7932999272" title="D7K5904"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7932999272_cd21a1bd5a_h.jpg" width="800" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIKON&lt;/span&gt; D7000: f/5.6 at 268.3s, 5.6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;. 200.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;fixed&amp;nbsp;lenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not the first to say it out loud but I like to remind myself that I have always felt like this, since my early days on the Yashica &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;-3. And therefore, every time I read some better articulated &amp;#8216;pro&amp;#8217; photographer decanting the virtues of fixed-lens photography, I feel peace and&amp;nbsp;happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s something that goes back to when I had little money so I quickly learnt the value of fixed lenses; cheaper and better quality than zooms, they force you to move around and to find better vantage points for your&amp;nbsp;photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if I do have some more money now, still I like the self-discipline that fixed lenses force on you. Maybe I just value more the quality of a lens (faster apertures, better optical quality) and the weight of it over the convenience of having just one big bulky lens. That&amp;#8217;s why I have three 50mm Nikkors, a 35mm f/1.8, an 85mm f/1.8, a 200mm f/4, a 17mm f/2.8 (for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1) and just one zoom (Tokina 12-24mm&amp;nbsp;f/4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7511025756" title="D7K4241"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/7511025756_28776869cf_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIKON&lt;/span&gt; D7000: f/8.0 at 1/640s, 8.0 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;. 100.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;random thoughts on the&amp;nbsp;d7000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many &lt;em&gt;fps&lt;/em&gt; do you need? The other day I was shooting some pics at a bike race. I put the continuous-high speed drive. Holding the shutter down meant a rat-tat-tat-tat sequence, unbelievable &amp;#8212; apparently this thing goes up to 6fps. Do you really need more? Then you&amp;#8217;re a fuckin&amp;#8217; pro, and you don&amp;#8217;t need to read anything here because you already know&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the &lt;em&gt;magnesium-whatever body&lt;/em&gt;; I like how this camera is built. It&amp;#8217;s certainly not a tank but it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel fragile which is the most important thing. And I don&amp;#8217;t go light on my D7000, I mean I rarely use a proper bag, I put it down in the dirt or on the rocks when I&amp;#8217;m outdoor hiking or cycling, and it scratches, yes, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t break. So the fat nerds that discuss at lengths on the internet about how this camera is not for a &amp;#8216;pro&amp;#8217;, well they really should just get out&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;dynamic range&lt;/em&gt; is just incredible. You can retrieve so much information from badly over/under-exposed photos in processing that is just mind&amp;nbsp;blowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very good quality at &lt;em&gt;high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but you get used quickly to these things; it&amp;#8217;s only when I go back and compare some 1600 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; shots of the D7000 with those of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; or the D70s that I go &amp;#8216;wow&amp;#8217; once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to &lt;em&gt;shoot video&lt;/em&gt; is great and all the efforts to create some good, thoughtful shots (an easy-to-use handycam it ain&amp;#8217;t) makes you feel like Scorsese. It&amp;#8217;s true what they say, if you wanna shoot video buy a proper camcorder; but what is also true is that a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; gives you enormous flexibility in framing the shots and excellent video quality, and the final results have that cinematic quality that still impresses me. But yes, I do agree that we need to restrain ourselves from abusing the shallow depth-of-field&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that for today&amp;#8217;s computers &lt;em&gt;16 Megapixels&lt;/em&gt; are just fine; we can crop the hell out of these files and still have enough pixels to make some large prints. A mid-level computer has enough grunt to process these files with little effort (my old 2.66 Ghz Macmini didn&amp;#8217;t, so that&amp;#8217;s why I built myself a &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html"&gt;hackintosh&lt;/a&gt;). I just don&amp;#8217;t understand the 36Mp of the D800; I&amp;#8217;ve played with the beatiful 12Mp files out of a D700 and they are just great, do we really need&amp;nbsp;36Mp?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;further&amp;nbsp;readings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could have spared some time by referring to this article: &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/04/15/some-good-things-D7000"&gt;http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/04/15/some-good-things-D7000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also check out my &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;review of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt; and some of the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2011-12-20-winter-riding-milano-episode-1.html"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve shot &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-02-09-winter-riding-milano-episode-2.html"&gt;with the D7000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually my weekly snaps are dominated by shots taken with the D7000 so you may wanna start from &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-10-weekly-snaps-1.html"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the need for megapixels look at what @rwboyer says &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/17/beater-camera-follow-up-nikon-d2h-the-beast/"&gt;about the old Nikon D2h&lt;/a&gt;, a 4 Mp camera (and look at these incredible shots by Ming Thein: &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/07/18/inspirations-d2h-1/"&gt;Inspirations from older cameras: the Nikon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;D2H&lt;/span&gt;, part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/07/20/inspirations-d2h-2/"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;). Ming Thein also has a &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/09/16/points-of-sufficiency-do-you-really-know-how-much-is-enough/"&gt;lengthier piece on the megapixels frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, worth reading: I particularly like the idea of a &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; 3Mp&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About shooting with a fixed lens: as somebody wrote somewhere (can&amp;#8217;t find the reference now!) when you buy the X100 is like buying a magnificent 35mm f/2 lens &amp;#8212; and they &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; give you a nice body attached! So it&amp;#8217;s really about the beauty of shooting within certain constraints that forces the photographer to be more&amp;nbsp;creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7932932478/" title="D7K6241 Portra 160 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7932932478_6cc1505c54_z.jpg" width="640" height="427"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;update on backfocusing issue&amp;nbsp;(2/10/2012)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having written so many good things about the D7000, I just have to write something about the &amp;#8216;famous&amp;#8217; back focusing issue (definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a good&amp;nbsp;thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to California for my friend Daniele&amp;#8217;s wedding, and it was me and my good friend Dylan, playing with our cameras (he&amp;#8217;s got a D700 with some serious lenses), and we were shooting wide open just for the sheer pleasure of it; I had this brand new 85mm f/1.8 but could not get the sharp pictures I was expecting. When I looked at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; screen the pictures were slightly blurred or out of focus, but since I&amp;#8217;ve never trusted those screens too much I have never been worried about not seeing things &amp;#8216;sharp&amp;#8217; in there. But Dylan who evidently uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; much more than me, was surprised to see the blurred look of my shots and stated that if I was focusing on the eyelashes at f/1.8 with fast enough shutter speeds those eyelashes &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be sharp when zooming in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I guess that&amp;#8217;s what really helps when you share physical experiences and not just talk about something over emails or phone; there are things that seem too trivial to discuss, and very often you end up believing that what&amp;#8217;s wrong is instead&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I realized that this was the famous backfocusing issue that was a big hit on the internet forums when the D7000 was introduced. I searched to see what was the solution and found out several discussions that were all invariably too long and boring, arguing about the need to set up a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt;-stye experiment to find the correct values to feed in the focus fixing menu of the D7000. It&amp;#8217;s always like this when you read about photography equipment, it all seems so complicated that all the fun is taken&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have acquired in my late age a confidence in finding adequate if not top-quality solutions to my problems. So early in the morning of the 27th of September, in a cozy room overlooking San Francisco&amp;#8217;s bay,  I set up a very quick way to fix the backfocusing&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a booklet with something written on the backcover, put it straight up on a wall where the sun light shone, and took a hand-held shot with my first lens, the 35mm f/1.8G at its widest aperture. Zoomed all the way in and found that the words were all out of focus; not blurred because the shutter speed was fast enough (and my hands are also steady) to rule out this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in the &amp;#8220;Setup/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tune&amp;#8221; menu of the D7000 and insted of going -1, -2, -3, etc. I jumped straight to -10, then -20 and then checked against the test shot; and sure as hell even on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; I could see a marked improvement at -10. I fine tuned the setting with another couple of shots and finally got -13 for my&amp;nbsp;35mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then mounted the 85mm and repeated the procedure. Very quickly, I was able to test all the 4 lenses that I had with me, only half an hour work, and now I can safely lock on the eyelashes and have them tack sharp like you&amp;#8217;re supposed to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read on the internet that the distance I was supposed to take the picture of the test target should have been some very accurate multiple of the focal length but what the fuck; I just made sure that when changing from lens to lens I used a distance roughly proportional to the focal length, trying to keep the same proportions between the frame and the size of the photographed&amp;nbsp;booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the backfocusing issue of the D7000 is real, and may affect your D7000 too; I think you would be able to see it though only if using fast lenses because with consumer lenses like my 55-200 I could not see shit (at f/4 the depth of field is probably large enough to hide any misfocusings). It&amp;#8217;s lens-dependent, so for example my Tokina 12-24mm is not affected. Most importantly, there is a way built in your camera that Nikon gives you to fix this problem, and you don&amp;#8217;t need to set up a complicated experiment like the internet nerds want you to&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask how is it possible that I have never faced the problem before. I guess the reason is firstly of habit, that is after a while you just think it&amp;#8217;s your fault the shots were not sharp (shutter speed too slow, wrong positioning of the focus point, and so on); second, that if you&amp;#8217;re not constantly using your lenses at full aperture you may end up with reasonably sharp photo because at f2.8 or f4 there is enough depth of field to extend your area of&amp;nbsp;sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish off, a few links where the issue of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tuning is treated much more extensively. If you fall asleep reading these things don&amp;#8217;t worry, you&amp;#8217;re perfectly&amp;nbsp;normal.&lt;/p&gt;

In the meantime, Panasonic has churned out countless other iterations on the same micro four/thirds concept; but to me it has somehow watered down the concept and only the latest one (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX1&lt;/span&gt;), seems to be the true successor of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s only appropriate to post now a few words on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;; I know, it is indeed a very late review&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-fuori-tempo"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-fuori-tempo" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it could be of some interest to cheapskates that are looking for a nice and little second-hand camera (or maybe convince those of you affected by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:gas"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gas" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; is still &amp;#8220;good&amp;nbsp;enough&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5725746660/" title="1010831.jpg by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5308/5725746660_b027f4978d_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="1010831.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what I said at the very&amp;nbsp;beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true what everybody said back when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; came out; it is indeed a camera that puts the fun back into photography. Small enough to carry it everywhere on my bike rides, squeezed in my backpack between a sandwich, a sweaty t-shirt and a spare tube. And with plenty of photographic power to shame most other&amp;nbsp;DSLRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In august 2010 I wrote a short post titled &lt;a href="{filename}2010-08-19-my-next-camera.,d"&gt;&amp;#8220;my next camera&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;; the month after I happened to be in Livigno and &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-09-11-it-was-unintentional.html"&gt;by pure chance I bought the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5401364927/" title="_1000664.jpg by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5259/5401364927_7a9ca37738_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="_1000664.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the&amp;nbsp;lenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have an ideal set of lenses; well to be honest I don&amp;#8217;t even have multiple lenses, but just the one little crappy Olympus 17mm f/2.8. It&amp;#8217;s a lens that always come up second when compared to the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 but it does offer a slightly wider field of view (34mm-equivalent as opposed to the 40mm-equivalent of the Panasonic). The problem is obviously that it&amp;#8217;s rather slow (f/2.8 compared to f/1.7), and it&amp;#8217;s this stop and a half that bothers me more than the optical&amp;nbsp;defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have an adaptor ring for Nikon lenses (that I still have) and a &lt;a href="http://wanderlustcameras.com/products/pinwide.html"&gt;Pinwide&lt;/a&gt;, which is a plastic cap with a tiny hole in the middle; however both of these things were stolen from my house last January when thieves broke into my house (they also stole my Nikon F70 &amp;#8212; a film &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; and more annoyingly a perfectly good Nikon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; 20mm&amp;nbsp;f/2.8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptor ring allowed me to use two Nikon lenses: an old manual-focus 105mm f/2.8 Micro and a 50mm f/1.8. The 50mm became a very light long-lens (100mm-equivalent) which was easy to use and gave me incredibly good results. The 105mm is too big and heavy for this camera and I was only able to use it effectively when mounted on a&amp;nbsp;tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7693974058/" title="_1050999 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7125/7693974058_e2c0854633_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="_1050999"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1, anello adattatore Nikon-m4/3 e obiettivo Nikon 50mm f/1.8, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 200, 1/80s, diaframma non registrato.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;test comparativo-ossessivo-compulsivo: Panasonic vs&amp;nbsp;Olympus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I said before
Ã vero, l&amp;#8217;Olympus 17mm fa un po&amp;#8217; schifo rispetto al Panasonic; non c&amp;#8217;Ã¨ recensione sulla rete che non arrivi a queste conclusioni. E io dico sempre chissenefrega, le foto a scale micrometriche e le analisi a livello di pixel non mi interessano. Ammetto perÃ² di essermi lasciato prendere dal pixel-peeping convulsivo (malattia che colpisce gli assidui frequentatori di dpreview) a Natale 2010, quando rimasi bloccato a casa di Daniele ad Oxford a causa delle nevicate eccezionali che colpirono la Gran&amp;nbsp;Bretagna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecco i risultati, dei ritagli al 100% di noiosissime nature morte (biscotti Tesco, decorazioni natalizie, neve e un amplificatore esoterico e costosissimo) scattate con treppiede ed alternando i due obiettivi (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/sets/72157630860193170/"&gt;qui&lt;/a&gt; gli&amp;nbsp;originali):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;fotografia con focali&amp;nbsp;fisse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comunque sia, la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 con il 17mm Olympus resta una macchina compattissima e minimale. Non soffro della mancanza dello zoom visto che sono sempre stato abituato con le reflex ad andare in giro con due sole ottiche: un 28mm f/2.8 e un 50mm f/1.8. Tra l&amp;#8217;altro, il mio primo esperimento con ottiche fisse fu proprio col bellissimo 35mm f/2 Nikkor montato sulla F70 a pellicola; quindi la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 col 17mm (=34mm equivalente) replica quasi perfettamente quella visione del mondo che avevo con la&amp;nbsp;F70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una ottica fissa leggermente grandangolare Ã¨ stimolante, veloce, accattivante e&amp;nbsp;istruttiva:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veloce&lt;/em&gt; perchÃ© non devi regolare l&amp;#8217;escursione focale prima di scattare ma solo apertura e&amp;nbsp;fuoco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5725172693/" title="_1010799.jpg by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5210/5725172693_dc003e9b98_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="_1010799.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stimolante e istruttiva&lt;/em&gt; perchÃ© devi camminare e spostarti fisicamente per avere l&amp;#8217;inquadratura voluta, quindi ti costringe ad abbandonare la cattiva abitudine di usare lo zoom come sostituto della della distanza fisica tra osservatore e osservato&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-zoom"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-zoom" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accattivante&lt;/em&gt; perchÃ© il mio punto di vista leggermente snob mi spinge ormai a guardare con sufficienza i fotografi dotati di reflex e parco ottiche esagerate, e invece guardo con ammirazione i cocciuti con reflex a pellicola, reflex a tracolla con ottica fissa, compatte anomale (Sigma &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DP&lt;/span&gt;-1, Fuji X100) e, naturalmente, le micro quattroterzi (Olympus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP&lt;/span&gt;-1/2 o Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5791771894/" title="_1020498.jpg by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3053/5791771894_5b3ce9d73b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="_1020498.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sul tema degli obiettivi a focale fissa vi riporto un commenti di Steve Huff, uno che usa troppi esclamativi per i miei gusti e fa delle recensioni modello Ken Rockwell, cioÃ¨ un po&amp;#8217; troppo confusionarie (e male impaginate) &amp;#8212; ma in questo caso ci ha preso in&amp;nbsp;pieno:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs all about simplicity and knowing what to expect from the camera. After a couple of weeks shooting with a camera like the X100/X1 you will start to be able to visualize in your head what your image will look like. You will know what angle to get, where to stand and you will get out of the âZoom Lensâ mindset, which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMO&lt;/span&gt;, makes you lazy. Now of course, sports shooters and wildlife guys need powerful zooms (or primes) but for most of us, including the hobbyists, it could be a great experience to just shoot with one lens and one lens only for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do it all the time. I could get by day to day with either a 35 or a 50. My favorite lens in the world is the Leica Noctilux, and right behind that the new 35 Summilux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASPH&lt;/span&gt;. I have shot with a 35 for months on end, and did the same with a 50. Did my photography suffer because of it? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;, in fact, it had the opposite&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shooting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONLY&lt;/span&gt; a 35mm lens for say, 3 months, will open up your mind to other possibilities. You will not just aim, zoom and shoot but you will look around, think and ask yourself how you can get the best shot with what you have. Shooting at 35mm seems natural. You can get great environmental portraits and even normal portraits if you step back a bit. 35mm is great for landscape and urban shots. It kind of sucks you in to the image at times and is not too wide like a 24 or 28 might be, nor is it too constricted like a 50 can be in some&amp;nbsp;situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;scattare con la&amp;nbsp;gf-1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non ho consigli o suggerimenti da dare. Vi potrei raccontare che solitamente scatto a prioritÃ  di diaframmi, che ho sempre la macchina settata a 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; e poi aumento la sensibilitÃ  all&amp;#8217;occorrenza; che mi fido dell&amp;#8217;autofocus della macchina ma non dei sistemi piÃ¹ avanzati tipo multi-point &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; o face-detection - uso un punto singolo che poi sposto all&amp;#8217;occorrenza con le freccette (ma anche questa Ã¨ una conquista relativamente recente, visto che mi viene comunque piÃ¹ istintivo usare il focus lock sul punto prescelto e riposizionare fisicamente la macchina). Del bilanciamento del bianco me ne frego perchÃ© scatto sempre in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomma, per me la macchina fotografica ideale Ã¨ un qualcosa dotato di un sensore micidiale, un &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; veloce ma &amp;#8220;semplice&amp;#8221;, un sistema esposimetrico matrix e spot, ottiche fisse luminose, e una ghiera per scegliere prioritÃ  di tempi, di diaframmi o manuale. Tutto il resto lo&amp;nbsp;sottoutilizzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PerÃ² colgo sempre spunti interessanti dalle letture che si fanno in rete. E uno di questi mi ha portato a configurare uno dei custom mode della &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 nella modalitÃ  che ho battezzato &lt;em&gt;street-stealth-photography&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;mode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho impostato l&amp;#8217;autofocus con face detection, film mode B/W Dynamic (contrast +1, sharpness +2), auto-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;. In questo modo mi affido quasi ciecamente alla macchina per mettere a fuoco sul viso delle persone, impostare i parametri di scatto, lascio che la sensibilitÃ  aumenti fino al livello critico di 1600 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; (parecchio rumore ma ricordiamoci che stiamo lavorando under cover e l&amp;#8217;importante Ã¨ portare a casa un&amp;#8217;immagine!), automaticamente processare l&amp;#8217;immagine come jpeg in bianco e nero bello&amp;nbsp;contrastato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L&amp;#8217;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt; mode lo uso per poter scattare al volo delle foto in condizioni difficili o in cui Ã¨ poco pratico piazzarsi per bene, portare la macchina al viso, inquadrare correttamente, scegliere fuoco e tempi e diaframmi. Insomma quando si vuole rubare uno scatto al volo di persone interessanti, quando si vuole catturare un&amp;#8217;istantanea che abbia quelle qualitÃ  un po&amp;#8217; magiche della street photography fatta con Kodak Tri-X e macchine a telemetro; quando l&amp;#8217;unica visione che rende le asperitÃ  della cittÃ  Ã¨ quella che ti restituisce un bianco e nero fortemente sbilanciato sul nero e sui microcontrasti; quando vuoi documentare qualche evento speciale (ma anche comune!) e vuoi renderlo subito accessibile ad altri, quindi non puoi passare attraverso la inevitabile procedura di elaborazione a tavolino a cui bene o male il formato &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; ti &amp;#8220;costringe&amp;#8221; (grazie al miraggio di infinite possibilitÃ  e possibilitÃ  di miglioraremento&amp;nbsp;dell&amp;#8217;istantanea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/6751767403/" title="_1060738 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7035/6751767403_7f48cf8fb1_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="_1060738"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 permette di creare facili video in formato &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; (1280x720); &amp;#8216;facilÃ¨ qui Ã¨ la parola chiave, visto che trovo molto piÃ¹ immediato usare la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 della Nikon D7000, che richiede un approccio piÃ¹ ragionato, anche a causa delle dimensioni. &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest-video/"&gt;Come dice Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera excels at capturing off the cuff snippets of moving-life along your&amp;nbsp;travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecco due esempi di video che ho creato con &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 e&amp;nbsp;17mm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxford, dicembre&amp;nbsp;2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;una critica&amp;nbsp;negativa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come ho scritto all&amp;#8217;inizio, non voglio far qui una recensione ragionata della &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 visto che ormai se ne Ã¨ parlato abbondantemente. All&amp;#8217;inizio pensavo anche di raccogliere i pareri trovati in giro sulla rete e fare una meta-critica. Poi la voglia mi Ã¨ passata, ma Ã¨ restato qualcosa, e cioÃ¨ un senso di stizza per una &lt;a href="http://www.sansmirror.com/cameras/a-note-about-camera-reviews/panasonic-camera-reviews/panasonic-gf1-review.html"&gt;recensione molto miope di Thom Hogan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inizia male il suo&amp;nbsp;pezzo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you set a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX3&lt;/span&gt; next to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1, you can see the design inheritance very easily. Thatâs not to say there arenât differences. But more on that&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way, you expect a 4/3 camera to perform more like a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; than a compact camera. Weâll leave it at that for now. Iâll have more to say in the Performance section later&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question, of course, is do you sacrifice usability or performance for that reduction. Iâll answer those questions later in the&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 a good subsitute for a compact camera, and how does it compare to the Olympus E-P1? Iâll try to answer both questions in the remainder of this&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notate i vari &amp;#8220;more on that later&amp;#8221;? Bene, se vuoi dire una cosa dilla e non continuare a ripetere che la dirai in un altro punto della tua recensione. Ã davvero irritante; e lo so, mi rendo anche conto che sia assolutamente irrilevante ai fini di un giudizio su un aggeggio meccanico ma che ci volete fare, mi mette di&amp;nbsp;malumore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il malumore aumenta quando si passa alle motivazioni&amp;nbsp;tecniche:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eleven (!) buttons and one controller on the back of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 (&amp;#8230;) And the rear dial is (&amp;#8230;) two controllers because it has a âswitchâ built into the dial. All this extra work really didnât make the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 âbetterâ than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX3&lt;/span&gt; for controllability. (&amp;#8230;) One thing thatâs starting to bug me are the use of dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WB&lt;/span&gt;, and other buttons (arrayed in a circle and doubling as up/down/left/right buttons) plus the Quick Menu function. The Quick Menu function is good enough that a dedicated button isnât really saving me much time and&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quindi, anche se uno dei vantaggi di una reflex Ã¨ proprio quello di avere pulsanti e ghiere separati per gestire tutte le principali funzioni, Thom vede l&amp;#8217;abbondanza di pulsantini sulla &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 come uno&amp;nbsp;svantaggio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basta questo per farmi perdere qualsiasi fiducia in lui. Io preferisco avere un pulsante dedicato a controllare sensibilitÃ  e bilanciamento del bianco piuttosto che immergermi in un menÃ¹ con freccettine, selezione, invio. La chiave del gioco per la maggior parte della fotografia che a me interessa (azione, street, candid) Ã¨&amp;nbsp;l&amp;#8217;immediatezza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
So, while the major advantage of SLRs is to have dedicated buttons that control all the major functions of the camera, Thom says that this is actually a negative point of the GF-1. Excuse me but this is bullshit. Iâd very much prefer a dedicated ISO and white balance button than a single one with some sort of menu system. Immediacy is the key.

&lt;p&gt;Ormai viziato dall&amp;#8217;incredibile sensore della D7000, tendo a usare la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 come compatta adatta a gite escursionistiche, quando lo spazio (nello zaino) e il peso sono gli elementi principali di cui tener conto. Spesso continuo a fare errori grossolani come ad esempio quello di scattare in jpg&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-raw"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-raw" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, e allora i risultati sono cosÃ¬ deludenti (colori smorti e tendenti al viola malato) che mi viene voglia di darla via questa inutile macchinetta, usare l&amp;#8217;iPhone per fare istantanee al volo da condividere con amici e tenere come semplice memorandum di dove sono&amp;nbsp;stato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7693325112/" title="_1010424 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7273/7693325112_a3de482e9a_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="_1010424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poi mi ravvedo, ricordo alcune immagini che questo piccolo gioiello mi ha permesso di catturare, e penso di proseguire questo rapporto, magari provando qualche altro obiettivo come il Panasonic 14mm f/2.5 (recensione di &lt;a href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2011/02/16/the-panasonic-14mm-2-5-micro-43-lens-review-by-steve-huff/"&gt;Steve Huff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/14mm/"&gt;Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt; e &lt;a href="http://www.londonstreetphoto.org/14mm-lens-review/"&gt;Peter Thomson&lt;/a&gt;) o addirittura un Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 che resta la migliore ottica in giro - ma appunto per questo Ã¨ introvabile sull&amp;#8217;usato e costa ancora parecchio&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-prezzi-panasonic"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-prezzi-panasonic" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppure abbandonare completamente il sistema micro quattroterzi e buttarmi sul mondo Fuji; c&amp;#8217;Ã¨ ormai in giro da un po&amp;#8217; questa X100 di cui leggo &lt;a href="http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100-review/"&gt;cose&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2011/4/13/a-different-beast.html"&gt;mirabolanti&lt;/a&gt;, e che mi fa molta, molta&amp;nbsp;gola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;altre letture&amp;nbsp;interessanti&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La principale lettura che suggerirei a chi ancora non la conoscesse Ã¨ &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/GF-1-fieldtest/"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 field test&amp;#8221; di Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt;, un bellissimo diario di viaggio in Himalaya inframmezzato di considerazioni tecniche da perfetto nerd e belle&amp;nbsp;foto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due letture piacevoli sono comparse anche su wired.com: &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/01/hands-on-with-panasonics-leica-lite-GF-1/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Hands on&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; di Charlie Sorrell e il suo seguito &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/02/a-month-with-the-lumix-GF-1-and-why-i-no-longer-use-the-nikon-d700/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Why I no longer use the Nikon D700&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infine, se proprio non ne avete abbastanza, ecco &lt;a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/25129/Lumix+GF-1+Review.html"&gt;la recensione di Danny Choo&lt;/a&gt; e un interessante &lt;a href="http://reviewers.tumblr.com/post/535639407/GF-1-vs-5dmkii"&gt;confronto con la Canon 5D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:nota-raw"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avendo sempre scattato raw, devo ancora sperimentare i vari settaggi colore della macchina; probabilmente basta un &amp;#8220;vivid&amp;#8221; per migliorare la cosa. O semplicemente continuare a scattare in raw, visto che la qualitÃ  dei jpg della macchina Ã¨ sempre stato un &lt;a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF-1/33"&gt;punto critico&lt;/a&gt; della &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-raw" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-fuori-tempo"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like I&amp;#8217;m not the only one to write about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; in 2012, three years after it first appeared on the market. There is a &lt;a href="ttp://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2012/04/10/the-panasonic-gf-1-an-old-friend-re-visited-by-colin-steel/"&gt;nice commentary by Colin Steel&lt;/a&gt; which appeared earlier this year on one of those popular blogs.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-fuori-tempo" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:gas"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gear Acquisition Syndrome. Everybody talks &lt;a href="http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2012/03/04/10-tips-on-how-to-cure-yourself-of-gas-gear-acquisition-syndrome"&gt;about it&lt;/a&gt; on the internet: google it up.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:gas" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-zoom"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stortura imposta dalla scarsa cultura fotografica e propagata dalla dilagante diffusione di superzoom 28-200.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-zoom" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-prezzi-panasonic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad oggi il Panasonic 14mm si trova di seconda mano su amazon.com a circa $200 (cioÃ¨ circa â¬150) e nuovo $245, il 20mm usato $360 e nuovo $480!.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-prezzi-panasonic" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
