For&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know Leica: stupidly expensive cameras that are more likely to be kept in a closet or worn like a piece of jewellery than actually used (it wasn&amp;#8217;t like that before, when actual journalists back in the fifties used it as a fast, robust little camera to be used in the&amp;nbsp;field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even if now they seem to be more of a fashion statement, I have always liked the impression of solidity, their simplicity, and that funky way of setting the focus&lt;sup id="fnref:real-leica"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:real-leica" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But I would have never considered one for real if I had not played with the original Monochrom; that really changed something, the simple pleasure of using and holding this rather large, deceiptively simple and &amp;#8220;dense&amp;#8221; camera changed somehow my perception of Leicas. I will be honest and declare it right now that none of this matters when it comes to photography; but I&amp;#8217;m talking about something else here, I&amp;#8217;m talking about very elementary pleasures that are tangentially related to the actual making of photographs; the same pleasure that I get from using bycicles or a Faber-Castell pencil for&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I went on and looked for older digital models like the M8.2 and the M9, and for cheap lenses that I could afford; however after a cursory search on the internet my excitement quickly faded off and I realized that I&amp;#8217;d better get something&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24667920971" title="20151011_OMD0322.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24667920971_15e0438a86_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought about my D600 which was not going anywhere being so incredibly good at everything: comfortable and fast to use; incredible sensor output even now 3 years down the line &amp;#8212; regardless of all the shit and dust you can collect, it&amp;#8217;s still basically the same heart that powers the now much acclaimed&amp;nbsp;D750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the D600 was here to stay; what I was missing was probably a smaller camera that I could carry anywhere without second thoughts; a camera that I could throw in the backpack when I go biking somewhere or carry on my daily work commutes, something that I could have always with me to record snapshots&lt;sup id="fnref:snapshots"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:snapshots" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that sometimes change the balance of your&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24735187396" title="20151012_OMD0332.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1553/24735187396_248d3a2202_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And mind you, it&amp;#8217;s not that I am big-heavy-zoom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; user; on the contrary, the lenses that I use the most with my D600 are an old 50mm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; f/1.4 and a manual focus 28mm f/2.8. I am used to bring the Nikon with me everywhere but in actual fact, sometimes it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; indeed a bit heavy and cumbersome (I remember hiking with my little daughter in the backpack and the Nikon stuffed between sandwiches and&amp;nbsp;nappies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I could do with a small camera. And I still had good memories of &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that was lying unused somewhere. There were these small compact cameras with big sensor that were enticing (Nikon Coolpix A and Ricoh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GR&lt;/span&gt;) but their lenses were fixed 28mm-equivalent and I simply don&amp;#8217;t see that wide; if I only have one lens that&amp;#8217;s gonna be a 50mm or something like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24735192056" title="20151013_OMD0350.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1662/24735192056_10b00d9d19_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did an experiment; revived my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;, bought a new lens (a 50mm equivalent, obviously &amp;#8212; the Olympus 25mm f/1.8) and used it to document &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/pages/northbound.html"&gt;my trip up north&lt;/a&gt; at the end of August last year. And guess what &amp;#8212; I had fun with it, and at the end I got the proper images to tell my story; not particularly rich or detailed but good honest little black and white&amp;nbsp;snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was undeniable proof that I was on the right track; I kept my 25mm and completed the upgrade buying the &amp;#8216;old&amp;#8217; Olympus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM10&lt;/span&gt; (its second iteration had just been announced) and the 45mm f/1.8 taking advantage of the end-of-life discounts that Olympus Europe was having over the summer. The crazy thing is that I paid the body only 350 euros. With the same money I could probably have bought a knob of a Leica. And with 2.5 Leica-knobs I now had a tiny system covering all my most used focal lengths (I still had the old Panasonic 14mm &amp;#8212; a 28mm-equivalent &amp;#8212; from my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24643653612" title="20151017_OMD0564.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1465/24643653612_613074d553_h.jpg" width="533" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using the little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMD&lt;/span&gt; quite a lot since I&amp;#8217;m here in Norway. The 16 megapixels sensor may be rather old, and the stabilizer is only 3-way as compared to 5 of the newer Olympus, and the electronic viewfinder is just decent, but good enough to let you take photos. Pricewise the camera is a star and I would recommend it to everyone that knows his way around cameras (beginners should look somewhere else; too many things you can customize in here &amp;#8212; a beginner should be given this camera with most of the litte buttons taped over or glued to the case and at least one knob detached and stored away in a&amp;nbsp;closet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some blogger I now refrain from quoting once said that we have past reached the point of sufficiency with cameras. My D600 is 3 or 4 years old and its resolution, speed, transparency are so good that nothing could stop me from using it for many more years except lust for a shiny new gadget (or general&amp;nbsp;boredom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this Olympus is like a little D600&lt;sup id="fnref:sensor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sensor" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; the raw photographs are very malleable, just like the D600 &amp;#8212; well maybe a little less: a little less potential to recover the deep blacks or the highlights, a little less clean at high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, a little less comfortable and secure when holding it with one hand. But you know, &amp;#8220;a little less&amp;#8221; than a D600 it means that it is still astonishingly&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24667832401" title="20151009_OMD0083.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/24667832401_cbd614cf49_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly it is a big step above the old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;. With that camera I could feel the pain whenever the light was not 100-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; conditions. And composing with the rear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; was at times very irritating. And the stabilization system? I honestly did not think it was that big of a deal &amp;#8212; after all I have been shooting traditional (D)SLRs with no such helps for a long time. But these little cameras are inherently unbalanced due to their low weight so it&amp;#8217;s almost easier to keep steady a largish &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; body with a normal lens attached than one of them tiny&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The small flaws I have found are probably rather known; like you should know before even approaching one of these mirrorless cameras that they will exhaust the battery pretty quickly. So you have to have extra batteries (but perfectly good chinese knock-offs are available on amazon for two or three chocolate money). And the (lack of) grip compared to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; can be unnerving so you gotta use a strap (on my D600 most of the times I don&amp;#8217;t). Actually there is a tiny thumb-rest on the Olympus that it&amp;#8217;s really a brilliant idea and makes it slightly easier to hold (I know for example that users of the much more expensive Fuji X-Pro have to buy a second-party&amp;nbsp;thumb-rest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24761438715" title="20151016_OMD0452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1701/24761438715_81a60e475c_h.jpg" width="800" height="533"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the lenses I have are also very very good; the 25mm and the 45mm. The Panasonic 14mm f/2.5 on the other hand is a piece of shit but it&amp;#8217;s so tiny and cheap that it&amp;#8217;s difficult not to recommend over the more expensive options out there (also remember that I don&amp;#8217;t care too much about wide&amp;nbsp;angles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a flaw maybe it&amp;#8217;s this, and it&amp;#8217;s related to something I wrote at the beginning: there&amp;#8217;s too much electronics inside and this somehow bothers me. It bothers me that the shutter sound is too subdued; that there is a constant whirring sound when you switch it on (the stabilization system), and despite being surprisingly well built, it most definitely is not a solid piece of metal like a Leica. It is also a fraction of a second too slow in almost everything (switching from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVF&lt;/span&gt; to rear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;; activating the menus; locking the focus; etc.); nothing truly disturbing and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the most expensive siblings (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM5&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM1&lt;/span&gt;) would certainly be faster but all of these things they add up and make for a not entirely compelling&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know very well, I&amp;#8217;m making silly comparisons (a 350 euros Olympus compared to a Leica? and what do you mean by &amp;#8220;compelling&amp;#8221; anyway?). All I will say is that (confusingly enough) this is a fantastic little camera, it gives you the possibility to take great photos (which should be all that you need to worry about), but there is something that holds me from declaring it the best camera ever. I hope you weren&amp;#8217;t looking for a list of pros and cons and some &amp;#8220;final words&amp;#8221; on this camera; I think you can find them easily enough on other&amp;nbsp;websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For some more photos taken with this little camera point your browser to &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/albums/72157664053048131"&gt;this flickr album&lt;/a&gt;. All the photos included here are clickable too and will take you to their own flickr page where you can read geeky stuff like lens, aperture and shutter speeds (but don&amp;#8217;t do that because it&amp;#8217;s not really&amp;nbsp;important).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:real-leica"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously I&amp;#8217;m talking about the range finder Leicas: the various M-something.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:real-leica" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:snapshots"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approximate translation in italian of snapshots is &amp;#8220;istantanee&amp;#8221;, which means something that occurs at one moment and the next one is gone. Rather appropriate description for most of the photos I take.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:snapshots" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sensor"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do share the same father after all; both cameras have Sony sensor and I can see how similar they are when their raw files are subjected to heavy treatment.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sensor" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;#8217;s the impression you have from reading the rants in the dpreview forums, well it&amp;#8217;s wrong. And you should stop reading those forums (I know, I should too! It&amp;#8217;s just that sometimes something really clever comes up like the &lt;a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/thread/3377109"&gt;Dot Tune workflow to do &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tuning on Nikon DSLRs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24412301519" title="20130302_AA00692.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1680/24412301519_a5151833a8_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s actually a bit larger, not uncomfortably so however; it&amp;#8217;s still sized very reasonably, but it&amp;#8217;s more squat than the D7000 probably because it needs to accomodate that wonderfully large viewfinder. The overall feel is of a tougher and more grown-up camera than the D7000 (and the D7000 in my opinion is a perfectly mature body, a perfect compromise between the small and plasticky D3xxx/D5xxx and the hulky&amp;nbsp;D700/D3/D4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the new multi-controller, it feels more snappy and clickable than on the D7000; I don&amp;#8217;t understand the necessity to have a lever switch that commutes between camera and movie-mode liveview but maybe someday I&amp;#8217;ll get it. And yes, the location of the buttons is somewhat different (like the zoom in and out buttons are now reversed &amp;#8212; but in line with newer cameras such as D800 and D7100) and there&amp;#8217;s other little differences but really? Are you such a monkey that you cannot deal with the changes of a few buttons? That&amp;#8217;s the sort of criticism that I read on dpreview forums, and I just can&amp;#8217;t stand them. To me it seems on the other hand that Nikon is able to keep an incredible &amp;#8216;family feeling&amp;#8217; throughout the endless iterations from the D100 down to this new&amp;nbsp;D600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can easily wade through the very comprehensive menu system without even looking at the manual, and change the most important parameters (shooting mode, aperture, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, quality, etc.) without even thinking that this is a brand new camera. What&amp;#8217;s important is that when you hold the camera your fingers fall exactly where they are used to; the shutter button, the way it handles, it&amp;#8217;s all&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite my now subdued love for the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-12-17-fuji-test-day.html"&gt;new Fuji cameras&lt;/a&gt; and their wonderful simplicity (little knobs, real aperture ring) I still feel that the shape of a larger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; is ergonomically perfect. The little rangefinder-style cameras on the other hand (such as the Fuji &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XE&lt;/span&gt;-1 which I have tried, and loved, and wanted to buy) they don&amp;#8217;t feel that right to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;lunchtime break, a few snaps&amp;nbsp;later&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24151775454" title="20130223_AA00168.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1514/24151775454_e78580ac25_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I crazy? It seems to me that D600+50mm f/1.8D gives a me a brand new experience compared to the D7000+35mm f/1.8G; while they should be the same, really. Is it maybe due to the bright and large viewfinder where you can see so much more? Really unexpected and fantastic discovery this one; I was walking in my rather bleak suburban setting under a light snowfall and I found myself so excited to have this &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; lens to use. Yes, my old 50mm suddenly becomes a novelty, how&amp;#8217;s that for renovating your photographic eye without punching a hole in your (already depressed)&amp;nbsp;wallet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, you know how I made this purchase possible? By getting rid of two or three of my old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; lenses: the little 35mm f/1.G (sad to see this little fella go!), a really good Tokina 12-24 f/4 and the cheapo-uberplastik Nikon 55-200 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; f/4-5.6; the idea was that I could replace the 35mm f/1.8 (surely my most used lens on the D7000) with one of my three 50mm&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-50mm"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-50mm" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the 12-24 with an old 18mm f/3.5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-18mm"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-18mm" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I did have a longer lens, the wonderful 85mm f/1.8G, and then I have realized I really don&amp;#8217;t need anything else since I don&amp;#8217;t do sports or birds or stalking. So off they go these &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; lenses (less is more, right?) and here it comes a full frame camera which hopefully will keep me satisfied and engaged for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;D600 after a&amp;nbsp;D7000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it right to replace the D7000 with a D600? Well the D7000 remains a true little gem, considering how cheap it now goes in the second hand market (I sold mine for 550 euros), and its image quality and responsiveness and build quality is really something that will keep its owners happy for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/24153439234/" title="20130225_AA00346.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1567/24153439234_7572e54216_h.jpg" width="800" height="534"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s one thing I didn&amp;#8217;t like about the D7000, it would be the good deal of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine-tuning required before getting really sharp pictures; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it was my particular camera&amp;#8217;s problem &amp;#8212; I can&amp;#8217;t really say &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T buy a D7000 because it has a fine-tuning issue&amp;#8221;. Very likely you won&amp;#8217;t have this problem &amp;#8212; but you may well have another! If you want a a truly foolproof camera, built and quality-checked to higher standards you probably need to be ready to spend lots of money to get something like a&amp;nbsp;D4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#8217;s tangential to the main issue, which is about the D600 and whether or not is a reasonable upgrade to make after a D7000. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that this D600 will not instantly make me a better photographer. I&amp;#8217;m also pretty sure that my D7000 would have allowed me to grow in my photographic education with no real restraints. So if somebody is looking at some excuse to justify the move to a rather expensive full frame camera (because in my world 1600-2000 euros is a lot of money), well I can&amp;#8217;t give you&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are really good, I mean technically good, then you will find exciting the &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/11/27/d600-500-shots/"&gt;incredible highlights&lt;/a&gt; that you can &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/02/17/highlight-fetishist/"&gt;recover from the D600&lt;/a&gt;; I mean, if you&amp;#8217;re  able to use these capabilities for creative purposes then yes, there&amp;#8217;s the  justification to replace you D7000 with a D600. I&amp;#8217;m not like that and the kind of photographs that I like to take are pretty much well served by any modern&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t even feel like I have a gear acquisition syndrome, in fact (despite what my wife says) I am pretty balanced in my purchases and I only tend to buy new stuff once I feel like I have exhausted the possibilities that a certain piece of gear gives me&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-outgrow"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-outgrow" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So yes, the D600 is surely giving me cleaner pictures at high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, and it has twenty-four megapixels as opposed to sixteen, increased depth-of-field control due to the larger sensor alright &amp;#8212; but listen to me, these things have meant very little for me when I decided to&amp;nbsp;upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of economy, that is I was able to do this with a relative modest sum, and why the hell not. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a matter of aesthetics and nostalgia, that I liked the idea of using a 50mm and have a 50mm look, or maybe I liked the idea of looking through this larger and brighter viewfinder. Who knows, maybe I will need to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; this camera, see what I can do with that and come back here and write my thoughts, like I did for the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-09-21-thoughts-on-d7000.html"&gt;D7000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:nota-50mm"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right, three 50mm. I have had my trusty 50mm f/1.8D since the times of my first autofocus film camera (Nikon F70), then I have got from my father-in-law the 50mm f/1.4 and an old &lt;a href="http://www.djcphoto.com/index.php/nikkor-s-50mm-f1-4-non-ai-lens/"&gt;pre-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; f/1.4&lt;/a&gt; (the one with the sculpted focus ring which &amp;#8216;starred&amp;#8217; in Michelangelo Antonioni&amp;#8217;s Blow-Up).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-50mm" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-outgrow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s always been true with bikes and motorbikes, for example. I really pushed hard my Monster, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBR600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2008-03-23-speedweek-2007-su-mondoducati.html"&gt;Multistrada&lt;/a&gt; before finally ending up on the &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2008-10-20-999s-il-primo-giro.html"&gt;Ducati 999&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; and &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2009-08-27-speedweek-2009.html"&gt;outgrew&lt;/a&gt; this one too.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-outgrow" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s time to write something up about this&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the Nikon D7000 after a long apprenticeship. I started with a Yashica &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;-3 and its 50mm f/1.8, then I moved to a Nikon F70 (we&amp;#8217;re still in the ancient film era). After a few crappy compact digital cameras (and one less crappy than others, the Canon G5) I got my first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; (a Nikon D70s) which was excellent &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-08-19-my-next-camera.html"&gt;until it broke down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was always traveling and hiking and biking I wanted a smaller camera so I bought a &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-09-11-it-was-unintentional.html"&gt;Panasonic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt; that I &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-31-panasonic-gf1-late-review.html"&gt;still have&lt;/a&gt; (and will keep for many more years to come; it&amp;#8217;s still much better than any compact camera and only marginally&amp;nbsp;larger).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7932999272" title="2012-08-28_D7K5904"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8436/7932999272_cd21a1bd5a_h.jpg" width="800" height="530"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;268.3 sec. at f/5.6, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 200, 18 mm (Tokina &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; 12-24mm f/4, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIKON&lt;/span&gt; D7000).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;fixed&amp;nbsp;lenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not the first time that I declare it but I have always felt like this, in love with &amp;#8220;primes&amp;#8221;, since my early days on the Yashica &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;-3. And therefore, every time I read some better articulated &amp;#8216;pro&amp;#8217; photographer decanting the virtues of fixed-lens photography, I feel peace and&amp;nbsp;happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s something that goes back to when I had little money so I quickly learnt the value of fixed lenses; cheaper and better quality than zooms, they force you to move around and to find better vantage points for your&amp;nbsp;photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years have passed but I still enjoy the self-discipline that fixed lenses force on you. Maybe I just value more the quality of a lens (faster apertures, better optical quality) and the weight of it over the convenience of having just one big bulky lens. That&amp;#8217;s why I have lots of primes (two 50mm, one 35mm, one 85mm) and just one zoom (Tokina 12-24mm&amp;nbsp;f/4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;random thoughts on the&amp;nbsp;d7000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many &lt;em&gt;fps&lt;/em&gt; do you need? The other day I was shooting some pics at a bike race. I put the continuous-high speed drive. Holding the shutter down meant a rat-tat-tat-tat sequence, unbelievable &amp;#8212; apparently this thing goes up to 6fps. Do you really need more? Then maybe you are a real &amp;#8216;pro&amp;#8217;, and you don&amp;#8217;t need to read anything here because you already know&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like the &lt;em&gt;magnesium-whatever body&lt;/em&gt;; I like how this camera is built. It&amp;#8217;s certainly not a tank but it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel fragile which is the most important thing. And I don&amp;#8217;t go light on my D7000, I mean I rarely use a proper bag, I put it down in the dirt or on the rocks when I&amp;#8217;m outdoor hiking or cycling, and it scratches, yes, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;dynamic range&lt;/em&gt; is just incredible. You can retrieve so much information from badly over/under-exposed photos in processing that is just mind&amp;nbsp;blowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very good quality at &lt;em&gt;high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but you get used quickly to these things; it&amp;#8217;s only when I go back and compare some 1600 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; shots of the D7000 with those of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; or the D70s that I go &amp;#8216;wow&amp;#8217; once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to &lt;em&gt;shoot video&lt;/em&gt; is great and all the efforts to create some good, thoughtful shots (an easy-to-use handycam it ain&amp;#8217;t) makes you feel like Scorsese. It&amp;#8217;s true what they say, if you wanna shoot video buy a proper camcorder; but what is also true is that a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; gives you enormous flexibility in framing the shots and excellent video quality, and the final results have that cinematic quality that still impresses me. But yes, I do agree that we need to restrain ourselves from abusing the shallow depth-of-field&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think that for today&amp;#8217;s computers &lt;em&gt;16 Megapixels&lt;/em&gt; are just fine; we can crop the hell out of these files and still have enough pixels to make some large prints. A mid-level computer has enough grunt to process these files with little effort (my old 2.66 Ghz Macmini didn&amp;#8217;t, so that&amp;#8217;s why I built myself a &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-05-03-my-new-mac-is-a-hack.html"&gt;hackintosh&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;further&amp;nbsp;readings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could have spared some time by referring to this article: &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/04/15/some-good-things-D7000"&gt;http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/04/15/some-good-things-D7000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually my weekly snaps are dominated by shots taken with the D7000 so you may wanna start from &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-07-10-weekly-snaps-1.html"&gt;the first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the need for megapixels look at what @rwboyer says &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/17/beater-camera-follow-up-nikon-d2h-the-beast/"&gt;about the old Nikon D2h&lt;/a&gt;, a 4 Mp camera (also look at these shots by Ming Thein: &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/07/18/inspirations-d2h-1/"&gt;Inspirations from older cameras: the Nikon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;D2H&lt;/span&gt;, part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/07/20/inspirations-d2h-2/"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;). Ming Thein also has a &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com/2012/09/16/points-of-sufficiency-do-you-really-know-how-much-is-enough/"&gt;lengthier piece on the megapixels frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, worth reading: I particularly like the idea of a perfect 3Mp&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;update on backfocusing issue&amp;nbsp;(2/10/2012)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having written so many good things about the D7000, I just have to write something about the &amp;#8216;famous&amp;#8217; back focusing issue (definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a good&amp;nbsp;thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to California for my friend Daniele&amp;#8217;s wedding, and it was me and my other friend Dylan, playing with our cameras (he&amp;#8217;s got a D700 with some serious lenses), and we were shooting wide open just for the sheer pleasure of it; I had this brand new 85mm f/1.8 but could not get the sharp pictures I was expecting. When I looked at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; screen the pictures were slightly blurred or out of focus, but since I&amp;#8217;ve never trusted those screens too much I have never been worried about not seeing things &amp;#8216;sharp&amp;#8217; in there. But Dylan who evidently uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; much more than me, was surprised to see the blurred look of my shots and stated that if I was focusing on the eyelashes at f/1.8 with fast enough shutter speeds those eyelashes &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be sharp when zooming in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I guess that&amp;#8217;s what really helps when you share physical experiences and not just talk about something over emails or phone; there are things that seem too trivial to discuss, and very often you end up believing that what&amp;#8217;s wrong is instead&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I realized that this was the famous backfocusing issue that was a big hit on the internet forums when the D7000 was introduced. I searched to see what was the solution and found out several discussions that were all invariably too long and boring, arguing about the need to set up a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt;-stye experiment to find the correct values to feed in the focus fixing menu of the D7000. It&amp;#8217;s always like this when you read about photography equipment, it all seems so complicated that all the fun is taken&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have acquired in my late age a confidence in finding adequate if not top-quality solutions to my problems. So early in the morning of the 27th of September, in a cozy room overlooking San Francisco&amp;#8217;s bay,  I set up a very quick way to fix the backfocusing&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a booklet with something written on the backcover, put it straight up on a wall where the sun light shone, and took a hand-held shot with my first lens, the 35mm f/1.8G at its widest aperture. Zoomed all the way in and found that the words were all out of focus; not blurred because the shutter speed was fast enough (and my hands are also steady) to rule out this&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in the &amp;#8220;Setup/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tune&amp;#8221; menu of the D7000 and insted of going -1, -2, -3, etc. I jumped straight to -10, then -20 and then checked against the test shot; and sure as hell even on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; I could see a marked improvement at -10. I fine tuned the setting with another couple of shots and finally got -13 for my&amp;nbsp;35mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then mounted the 85mm and repeated the procedure. Very quickly, I was able to test all the 4 lenses that I had with me, only half an hour work, and now I can safely lock on the eyelashes and have them tack sharp like you&amp;#8217;re supposed to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read on the internet that the distance I was supposed to take the picture of the test target should have been some very accurate multiple of the focal length but what the fuck; I just made sure that when changing from lens to lens I used a distance roughly proportional to the focal length, trying to keep the same proportions between the frame and the size of the photographed&amp;nbsp;booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the backfocusing issue of the D7000 is real, and may affect your D7000 too; I think you would be able to see it though only if using fast lenses because with consumer lenses like my 55-200 I could not see shit (at f/4 the depth of field is probably large enough to hide any misfocusings). It&amp;#8217;s lens-dependent, so for example my Tokina 12-24mm is not affected. Most importantly, there is a way built in your camera that Nikon gives you to fix this problem, and you don&amp;#8217;t need to set up a complicated experiment like the internet nerds want you to&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask how is it possible that I have never faced the problem before. I guess the reason is firstly of habit, that is after a while you just think it&amp;#8217;s your fault the shots were not sharp (shutter speed too slow, wrong positioning of the focus point, and so on); second, that if you&amp;#8217;re not constantly using your lenses at full aperture you may end up with reasonably sharp photo because at f2.8 or f4 there is enough depth of field to extend your area of&amp;nbsp;sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish off, a few links where the issue of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; fine tuning is treated much more extensively. If you fall asleep reading these things don&amp;#8217;t worry, you&amp;#8217;re perfectly&amp;nbsp;normal.&lt;/p&gt;

In the meantime, Panasonic has churned out countless other iterations on the same micro four/thirds concept; but to me it has somehow watered down the concept and only the latest one (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX1&lt;/span&gt;) seems to be the true successor of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s only appropriate to post now a few words on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;; I know, it is indeed a very late review&lt;sup id="fnref:nota-fuori-tempo"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota-fuori-tempo" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but it could be of some interest to cheapskates that are looking for a nice and little second-hand camera (or maybe convince those of you affected by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:gas"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gas" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; is still &amp;#8220;good&amp;nbsp;enough&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;what I said at the very&amp;nbsp;beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true what everybody said back when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; came out; this is indeed a camera that puts the fun back into photography. Small enough to carry it everywhere on my bike rides, squeezed in my backpack between a sandwich, a sweaty t-shirt and a spare tube. And with plenty of photographic power to shame most other&amp;nbsp;DSLRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In august 2010 I wrote a short post titled &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-08-19-my-next-camera.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;my next camera&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;; the month after I happened to be in Livigno and &lt;a href="http://aadm.github.io/2010-09-11-it-was-unintentional.html"&gt;by pure chance I bought the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5401364927" title="2010-10-17_1000664.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5259/5401364927_7a9ca37738_b.jpg" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Denver.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;my&amp;nbsp;lenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have an ideal set of lenses; well to be honest I don&amp;#8217;t even have multiple lenses, but just the one little crappy Olympus 17mm f/2.8. It&amp;#8217;s a lens that always come up second when compared to the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 but it does offer a slightly wider field of view (34mm-equivalent as opposed to the 40mm-equivalent of the Panasonic). The problem is the maximum aperture, only f/2.8; it is this stop and a half that bothers me more than the optical&amp;nbsp;defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have an adaptor ring for Nikon lenses and a &lt;a href="http://wanderlustcameras.com/products/pinwide.html"&gt;Pinwide&lt;/a&gt;, which is a plastic cap with a tiny hole in the middle; however both of these things were stolen from my house last January when thieves broke into my house (they also stole my Nikon F70 &amp;#8212; a film &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; and more annoyingly a perfectly good Nikon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; 20mm&amp;nbsp;f/2.8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adaptor ring allowed me to use two Nikon lenses: an old manual-focus 105mm f/2.8 Micro and a 50mm f/1.8. The 50mm became a very light long-lens (100mm-equivalent) which was easy to use and gave me incredibly good results. The 105mm is too big and heavy for this camera and I was only able to use it effectively when mounted on a&amp;nbsp;tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7693974058" title="2011-09-11_1050999"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7125/7693974058_2785e710ae_h.jpg" width="600" height="800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A chamaleon, Madagascar (1/80 sec., aperture not recorded, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 200, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; and Nikon 50 f/1.8).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;primes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the shortcomings of the Olympus 17mm f/2.8, this is a lens that shines on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; as it makes it even more compact and minimalistic. I don&amp;#8217;t particularly regret zoom lenses since I have always used (D)SLRs with fixed lenses; I still have very fond memories of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; 35mm f/2 which I used a lot on my first autofocus film camera (Nikon F70). The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; with this lens (a 34mm-equivalent) replicates almost perfectly that vision I used to have with my old film&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not being very original here but I want to remember why shooting a fixed focal length (a &amp;#8216;prime&amp;#8217;) is so stimulating, fast, instructive and&amp;nbsp;engaging:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; because you don&amp;#8217;t need to decide which focal length to use before shooting, only shutter speed and&amp;nbsp;aperture;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/5725172693" title="2011-02-27_1010799.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5210/5725172693_dc003e9b98_b.jpg" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Venaria Reale, Torino.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;stimulating and instructive&lt;/em&gt; because you need to walk and move around to make the picture you want, therefore fighting the propensity of using the zoom as a substitute for physically changing your position in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just love watching the nerds that go around the world taking photographs with old film cameras and one small normal lens, or this new generation of quirky cameras (Sigma &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DP1&lt;/span&gt;, Fuji X100, and micro four/thirds such my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; or the Olympus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EP1&lt;/span&gt;). It may happen in the near future that quirky cameras will rule the world and that will be the moment when I will go back to DSLRs, just because being trendy is not for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;At Beppe&amp;#8217;s wedding, somewhere in Valle d&amp;#8217;Itria (Puglia).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About primes, there is a &lt;a href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2011/05/03/the-fuji-x100-digital-camera-real-world-review-by-steve-huff"&gt;something written by Steve Huff&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;d like to&amp;nbsp;quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâs all about simplicity and knowing what to expect from the camera. After a couple of weeks shooting with a camera like the X100/X1 you will start to be able to visualize in your head what your image will look like. You will know what angle to get, where to stand and you will get out of the âZoom Lensâ mindset, which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMO&lt;/span&gt;, makes you lazy. Now of course, sports shooters and wildlife guys need powerful zooms (or primes) but for most of us, including the hobbyists, it could be a great experience to just shoot with one lens and one lens only for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do it all the time. I could get by day to day with either a 35 or a 50. My favorite lens in the world is the Leica Noctilux, and right behind that the new 35 Summilux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASPH&lt;/span&gt;. I have shot with a 35 for months on end, and did the same with a 50. Did my photography suffer because of it? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;, in fact, it had the opposite&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shooting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONLY&lt;/span&gt; a 35mm lens for say, 3 months, will open up your mind to other possibilities. You will not just aim, zoom and shoot but you will look around, think and ask yourself how you can get the best shot with what you have. Shooting at 35mm seems natural. You can get great environmental portraits and even normal portraits if you step back a bit. 35mm is great for landscape and urban shots. It kind of sucks you in to the image at times and is not too wide like a 24 or 28 might be, nor is it too constricted like a 50 can be in some&amp;nbsp;situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;shooting a&amp;nbsp;gf1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really have tips or tricks. I could tell you that I usually use aperture priority, that I always have the camera set at 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; and then I raise the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; when I want rather than using auto-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; settings; that I trust the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; generally, but not the advanced modes like multi-point &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; or face-detection (I use the single central point then I simply focus and recompose). I don&amp;#8217;t care about white balance as I aways shoot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, my ideal camera is something with a hell of a sensor, fast &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; but really really simple, matrix and spot exposure, availability of bright prime lenses and some knobs to switch from manual to aperture or shutter priority and to set either of those basic settings. Everything else is a plus that I don&amp;#8217;t really&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I did experiment for a while with some settings that make heavy use of all the technical gizmos of these modern cameras; I call this mode &lt;em&gt;street-stealth-photography&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt;) mode. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AF&lt;/span&gt; is set to face-detection, film mode to B/W Dynamic (contrast +1, sharpness +2, which is a pretty contrasty black and white), auto-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;. I trust the camera to focus on people&amp;#8217;s faces, I leave auto-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; on limited to only reach 1600 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; (which makes for quite a lot of noise but what I&amp;#8217;m thinking is just snap something and bring it&amp;nbsp;home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt; mode helps when I  shoot in difficult conditions, where speed is key and I don&amp;#8217;t have time to choose shutter speed, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; etc; saving also these precooked JPEGs with a rather incisive black and white helps when I want my photographs to be ready as soon as they are offloaded from the camera, skipping the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; import and the inevitable tinkering that&amp;nbsp;follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; makes the creation of small, easy videos a fun activity, and immediacy is the keyword here; the D7000 is more powerful but it requires a lot more effort.
&lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest-video/"&gt;Craig Mod sums it up quite nicely:&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera excels at capturing off the cuff snippets of moving-life along your&amp;nbsp;travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two examples of little videos that I made with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;, the first one shot on the Mont Blanc in September 2010, the second during a snowfall in Oxford, later that&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;something negative for a&amp;nbsp;change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive comments and reviews are listed at the end of this article. But there has been a certain review which was rather full of negative points which left me surprised. Different opinions etc, but here there is a quote from &lt;a href="http://www.sansmirror.com/cameras/a-note-about-camera-reviews/panasonic-camera-reviews/panasonic-gf1-review.html"&gt;Thom Hogan&amp;#8217;s review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are eleven (!) buttons and one controller on the back of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8230;) And the rear dial is (&amp;#8230;) two controllers because it has a âswitchâ built into the dial. All this extra work really didnât make the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; âbetterâ than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX3&lt;/span&gt; for controllability. (&amp;#8230;) One thing thatâs starting to bug me are the use of dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WB&lt;/span&gt;, and other buttons (arrayed in a circle and doubling as up/down/left/right buttons) plus the Quick Menu function. The Quick Menu function is good enough that a dedicated button isnât really saving me much time and&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though one of the key selling points of DSLRs is to have lots of buttons and knobs so you don&amp;#8217;t have to use menus (inherently slower), Thom finds that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; has too many of them. I know what I would rather have these many buttons than a Quick Menu function. At first it may be confusing but if you use one camera you quickly learn to control it (while if you jump from one camera to another like many of these serial reviewers, I can see you could easily forget which is which). Immediacy is the key, especially with this type of&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;what other people&amp;nbsp;think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main article I recommend to everybody that would like to not only know the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt; a bit more in detail but also as an example of wonderful mash-up between tech writeup and travelogue is the &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/gf1-fieldtest/"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF&lt;/span&gt;-1 field test&amp;#8221; by Craig Mod&lt;/a&gt;.  I have found interesting his perspective on &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/14mm/"&gt;the minuscule Panasonic 14mm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also wrote something which at the time I judged lyrical and oh-so-powerful, but now it just seems a bit over-the-top; like something written by the guy who has never been to the mountains before and tries to say something new about a condition (climbing, the high mountains) that countless other adventurers have talked about with more knowledge and introspection. However, Mr Mod has definitely some affinity with words, and this rant is probably totally unjustified if he is as sincere as I wish him to be. Enjoy his &lt;a href="http://craigmod.com/journal/annapurna_moonrise/"&gt;Annapurna Moonrise&lt;/a&gt; because it also has some cool night shots made with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GF1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two good pieces also on wired.com: &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/01/hands-on-with-panasonics-leica-lite-gf1/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Hands on&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Charlie Sorrell and a follow-up by the same author: &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/02/a-month-with-the-lumix-gf1-and-why-i-no-longer-use-the-nikon-d700/"&gt;&amp;#8220;Why I no longer use the Nikon D700&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally a &lt;a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/25129/Lumix+GF-1+Review.html"&gt;proper review by Danny Choo&lt;/a&gt; and an interesting &lt;a href="http://reviewers.tumblr.com/post/535639407/GF-1-vs-5dmkii"&gt;comparison with a heavyweight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a &lt;a href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2012/04/10/the-panasonic-gf-1-an-old-friend-re-visited-by-colin-steel/"&gt;nice commentary by Colin Steel&lt;/a&gt; which appeared earlier this year on one of those popular blogs.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-fuori-tempo" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
