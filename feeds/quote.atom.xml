&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my idea is that yes, books give you something else, something that takes you away for longer times, requiring a committment to the act of reading and comprehension that is essential if you really want to go deep into a&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the blogs I read are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; useful and fun and clever and insightful; in other words, I love &amp;#8220;my&amp;#8221; bloggers (how bad this word sounds to me now that I spell it out; I&amp;#8217;d love to simply call them &amp;#8220;writers&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; and for a short list of them &lt;a href="#addendum-my-favourite-photography-blogs-circa-2014"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that I have found another one brilliant writer, and I&amp;#8217;m simply astounded he doesn&amp;#8217;t have more recognition or&amp;nbsp;traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joerg Colberg is the man. He maintains and writes this wonderful blog, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;Conscientious Photography Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently he&amp;#8217;s been doing this for 12 years! So there&amp;#8217;s this incredible archive of clever, well written reviews and opinion pieces and everything else on&amp;nbsp;photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just to give you an idea on how brilliant Mr Colberg really is, there is a piece &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/on_process/"&gt;On Process&lt;/a&gt; that people like &lt;a href="http://jefferysaddoris.com/"&gt;Jefferey Saddoris&lt;/a&gt; (one of the two &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosts) would get a kick out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am not gonna do any synopsis since it would be a waste of time &amp;#8212; plus he writes so much better than me. But there is a passage that I liked a&amp;nbsp;lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you’re lugging around an 8x10 camera or that you photographing your computer screen is pretty much irrelevant for the evaluation of your work. Unless, of course, we want to treat photography like a craft. But I don’t think that’s so&amp;nbsp;interesting&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting piece that got me very excited is &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/photography_after_photography"&gt;&amp;#8220;Photography after photography&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, 
because it&amp;#8217;s all about answering the question &amp;#8220;where do we go from here&amp;#8221;? I mean, do we still hang tight to the conventions established by the masters? Is really photography&amp;nbsp;stagnating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so interesting to me even though I may be so boringly classical in my compositions and photography; this piece was (and still is!) like a corkscrew that opened my head and instilled some ideas that I&amp;#8217;d like to go and test them&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a small excerpt (hoping that Mr. Colberg doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;mind):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography has finally arrived at its own existential crisis. I[t is far from being over - no medium is ever over as long as there is just an ounce of creativity left on this planet. [&amp;#8230;] But photography has long been running in a circle. Over the past ten years, it has increasingly become dominated by nostalgia and conservatism. Even the idea that we now need editors or curators to create meaning out of the flood of photographs ultimately is conservative, looking backwards when we could, no we should be looking&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is digital photography that has resulted in the current stasis of the medium. Given the possibilities, it is quite amazing to see how little digital photography has qualitatively changed photography. Quantitatively, oh sure. The number of photographs taken has exploded, especially since there are now cameras in places where there weren’t any&amp;nbsp;before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;addendum: my favourite photography blogs, circa&amp;nbsp;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, my favourite blogs are still largely the same I was reading two years ago &amp;#8212; which is incredible in internet shelf-life terms. It is also reassuring to follow people who are truly passionate in what they do and are not obsessed with today&amp;#8217;s mantra (monetization!) so that years on they still produce vivid and interesting pieces to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is my short photo-related bookmark list (in no particular&amp;nbsp;order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick Laroque, &lt;a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog"&gt;http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog&lt;/a&gt; (love his style and the quirky and sometimes very poetic write ups; also very knowledgeable in all technical&amp;nbsp;aspects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob Boyer, &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com"&gt;http://photo.rwboyer.com&lt;/a&gt; (I like his technical insights, his wonderfully funny rants against fuji, nikon, whatever, and the thing is that I like his blog even if I&amp;#8217;m not really interested in photographing models which is all he does&amp;nbsp;apparently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ming Thein, &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com"&gt;http://blog.mingthein.com&lt;/a&gt; (I would like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; to like his blog, because he&amp;#8217;s too knowledgeable, confident and successful for for my taste, plus he&amp;#8217;s only 28! &amp;#8212; but what he brings to the table is honesty and integrity and an incredibly professional attitude towards maintaing the blog with frequent&amp;nbsp;updates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gregory Simpson, &lt;a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography"&gt;http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography&lt;/a&gt; (he is just the kind of writer that I wish I was, truly doing his stuff with seemingly no care about what the current rend is &amp;#8212; and I love&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Johnston, &lt;a href="http://theonlinephotographer.com"&gt;http://theonlinephotographer.com&lt;/a&gt; (he has probably the most competent community commenting his articles. I dont care too much for his football insights or other stuff like that, but I find a lot of good information in there, just a shame that his blog is so outdated&amp;nbsp;graphically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joerg Colberg, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;http://cphmag.com&lt;/a&gt; (read&amp;nbsp;above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:nota-passive-watching-tv"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to equate the act of  scrolling down one&amp;#8217;s facebook or twitter updates with passively watching tv. I think the first is the modern day&amp;#8217;s equivalent of the latter &amp;#8212; and to be completely honest I have to say that many many times I have induldged in the brainless and compulsive checking of the damned feeds. That is why &lt;a href="2010-08-03-farewell-facebook.html"&gt;I gave up on Facebook years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I will do the same with linkedin soon &amp;#8212; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aadmtwi"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; so far remains the only connection that I have with anything &amp;#8220;social&amp;#8221;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-passive-watching-tv" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an article on the New York Times about the latest Spider-Man movie (the one filmed by Marc&amp;nbsp;Webb):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwen Stacy asks Peter Parker if he likes branzino: you know, “Like, the fish?”.&lt;br&gt;
Then she invites him to dinner, where everyone is saying “branzino”: Denis Leary (playing Gwen’s dad), Peter, Gwen again. We see a full branzino at the dinner table, neatly plated.&lt;br&gt;
Why branzino? The film never says — it just offers up this delightful serving of unexpected&amp;nbsp;weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments, a guy who does not forget to specify his title&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branzino is a New England cold water fish that is usually thrown out, but many restaurants and people interested in ecology believe its use may be a viable way to help reduce the destruction to cod, flounder and other more popular North Atlantic fish whose numbers [and size] are dwindling. There is a belief this will also be a long term benefit to the smaller family fishing economy in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;N.E.&lt;/span&gt; It was in all probability an ecology statement&amp;#8230;.and Dennis Leary is a true New&amp;nbsp;Englander.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Klein, Ph.D. South&amp;nbsp;Florida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for avoiding internet anonimity because it causes all sort of animal behaviour (see any internet forum debating politics or canon vs nikon merits or iphone vs&amp;nbsp;android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to specify to the world that you are a friggin Ph.D like if it gives more credit to your ideas, this I cannot&amp;nbsp;stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this so often in work emails &amp;#8212; and that&amp;#8217;s bad enough, but if you use it also when commenting some innocuous sentence about branzino (which is by the way not New England specific as I have been raised with branzino or spigola, and I&amp;#8217;m from Bari, Puglia) then you just sound like a pretentious&amp;nbsp;dick.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="notes"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>wildlife photographer of the year</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-11-05:/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Si tratta probabilmente dell&amp;#8217;unica mostra a cui vado volentieri.

&lt;p&gt;Rispetto all&amp;#8217;edizione del 2009 che vidi a Londra, le foto qui sono stampate e non visualizzate su pannelli &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; retroilluminati; all&amp;#8217;epoca mi colpì molto la resa su questi schermi retroilluminati (non eravamo forse ancora abituati agli iPad) ma comunque nulla da dire &amp;#8212; le stampe sono sempre affascinanti e in questo caso anche ben&amp;nbsp;illuminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le didascalie che accompagnano ogni foto sono piene di informazioni tecniche (macchina utilizzata, eventuali supporti, flash, e altro ancora) e viene anche raccontata la storia dietro ogni scatto. Ma qui temo che i curatori (o magari gli stessi fotografi) si siano lasciati prendere la&amp;nbsp;mano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giudicate&amp;nbsp;voi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;He had been following the family in Kenya&amp;#8217;s Masai Mara for the past two weeks.[&amp;#8230;] Over the past 20 years, I have probably spent more time with cheetahs than any other animal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2721&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=3"&gt;Family tree&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In the end, he waited four days. Then, finally, nature obliged.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2754&amp;amp;category=49&amp;amp;year=2011"&gt;Ant line&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;After three days on a small boat looking for polar bears in Repulse Bay, Nunavut, Canada, Joe got lucky.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2717&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=3"&gt;Polar power&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It took a couple of summers before I figured out how to photograph the scene.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2749&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=9"&gt;Boy meets nature&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Stephane took two hours to walk to Creux du Van in western Switzerland, laden with heavy equipment.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2769&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=12"&gt;Celestial arch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomma, se non fatichi un po&amp;#8217;, pare che la giuria non ti prenda in&amp;nbsp;considerazione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sto dunque valutando se partecipare il prossimo anno con queste due&amp;nbsp;fotografie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aadm/7653060226/" title="_D7K1491 by aadm, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8148/7653060226_bfe3903a8a_z.jpg" width="424" height="640" alt="_D7K1491"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Erano mesi che inseguivo questa volpe nella ostile campagna Piemontese. Volevo catturare una immagine forte che simboleggiasse i pericoli continui che fronteggiano questo ormai sparuto gruppo di bestie selvatiche, inseguite dalle micidiali armi del progresso. Ma questa volpe era incredibilmente furba e riusciva sempre a schivare tutte le auto. Quindi alla fine presi la situazione in pugno, preparai un complesso sistema di quattro flash, due pannelli riflettenti, tre Nikon D4 che avrebbero scattato in modo sincrono per documentare l&amp;#8217;avvenuto (e tirai pure fuori l&amp;#8217;iPhone che non si sa mai); poi mi misi sul mio &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt;, partii a razzo e finalmente tirai sotto questa maledettissima&amp;nbsp;volpe&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Erano dieci giorni che saltavo il dolce per trovare un momento senza nessun fottuto turista. Con grande coraggio, un giorno saltai anche il secondo e finalmente riuscii ad avere cinque minuti di solitudine a tu per tu col feroce e rapidissimo camaleonte malgascio, che fotografai con la mia Canon 1D e  105mm Macro f/1.4 (e tirai fuori l&amp;#8217;iPhone che non si sa&amp;nbsp;mai)&amp;#8221;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="photo"></category><category term="quote"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>notes on parenting</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-08-09-notes-on-parenting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-08-09:/2012-08-09-notes-on-parenting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been reading quite a lof of articles about parenting.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these articles are (as usual) very well written and are full of ideas that I have enjoyed. I want to keep updating this post every time I find something good. They may also help a future me because you never know what&amp;#8217;s behind the corner of becoming a&amp;nbsp;dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 1: &amp;#8220;Spoiled Rotten&amp;#8221; by Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;L.A.&lt;/span&gt; families observed, no child routinely performed household chores without being instructed to. Often, the kids had to be begged to attempt the simplest tasks; often, they still&amp;nbsp;refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Yanira had no clear role in the group, she quickly found ways to make herself useful. Twice a day, she swept the sand off the sleeping mats, and she helped stack the kapashi leaves for transport back to the village. In the evening, she fished for crustaceans, which she cleaned, boiled, and served to the others. Calm and self-possessed, Yanira “asked for nothing,” Izquierdo later recalled. The girl’s behavior made a strong impression on the anthropologist because at the time of the trip Yanira was just six years&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Most parents today were brought up in a culture that put a strong emphasis on being special, (&amp;#8230;) being special takes hard work and can’t be trusted to children. Hence the exhausting cycle of constantly monitoring their work and performance, which in turn makes children feel less competent and confident, so that they need even more&amp;nbsp;oversight.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) today’s incoming freshmen are less likely to be concerned about the rigors of higher education than &amp;#8220;about how they will handle the logistics of everyday&amp;nbsp;life&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, according to “Life at Home,” are disproportionate generators of clutter: “Each new child in a household leads to a 30 percent increase in a family’s inventory of possessions during the preschool years alone.” Many of the kids’ rooms pictured are so crowded with clothes and toys, so many of which have been tossed on the floor, that there is no path to the&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 2: &amp;#8220;Raising Successful Children&amp;#8221; by Madeline&amp;nbsp;Levine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is autonomous, confident and generally in accord with reality. If you treat your walking toddler as if she can’t walk, you diminish her confidence and distort reality. Ditto nightly “reviews” of homework, repetitive phone calls to “just check if you’re O.K.” and “editing” (read: writing) your child’s college application&amp;nbsp;essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging back and allowing children to make mistakes is one of the greatest challenges of&amp;nbsp;parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having tutors prep your anxious 3-year-old for a preschool interview because all your friends’ children are going to this particular school or pushing your exhausted child to take one more advanced-placement course because it will ensure her spot as class valedictorian is not involved parenting but toxic overparenting aimed at meeting the parents’ need for status or affirmation and not the child’s&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) the child’s job is to grow, yours is to control your anxiety so it doesn’t get in the way of his reasonable moves toward autonomy&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents also have to make sure their own lives are fulfilling. There is no parent more vulnerable to the excesses of overparenting than an unhappy parent One of the most important things we do for our children is to present them with a version of adult life that is appealing and worth striving&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) schools that worship at the altar of high achievement but do everything they can to undermine children’s growth and well-being: eliminating recess; assigning mind-deadening amounts of homework; and ranking, measuring and valuing kids by narrowly focused test scores, while cutting out other areas of creative education in which large numbers of students who don’t necessarily test well might find success and&amp;nbsp;thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;) the inconvenient truth remains that not every child can be shaped and accelerated into Harvard material. But all kids can have their spirits broken, depression induced and anxiety stoked by too much stress, too little downtime and too much attention given to external factors that make them look good to an audience of appraising eyes but leave them feeling rotten&amp;nbsp;inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 4: &amp;#8220;America’s Top Parent - What’s behind the Tiger Mother craze?&amp;#8221;  by Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chua, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, is a Yale Law School professor. She is married to another Yale law professor and has two daughters, whom she drives relentlessly (&amp;#8230;) In Chua’s binary world, there are just two kinds of mother. There are “Chinese mothers,” who, she allows, do not necessarily have to be Chinese (&amp;#8230;) Then, there are “Western” mothers. (&amp;#8230;) Chua chooses the instruments that her daughters will play and stands over them as they practice for three, four, sometimes five hours at a&amp;nbsp;stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Yes, you can brute-force any kid to learn to play the piano—just precisely like his or her billion neighbors&amp;#8221; is how one of the comments on the Wall Street Journal’s Web site put it. &amp;#8220;But you’ll never get a Jimi Hendrix that&amp;nbsp;way&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about the only category in which American students outperform the competition is self-regard&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting is hard. As anyone who has gone through the process and had enough leisure (and still functioning brain cells) to reflect on it knows, a lot of it is a crapshoot. Things go wrong that you have no control over, and, on occasion, things also go right, and you have no control over those, either. The experience is scary and exhilarating and often humiliating, not because you’re disappointed in your kids, necessarily, but because you’re disappointed in&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About cyclists (especially roadies) shaving their&amp;nbsp;legs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was based on sound principles of physics and human anatomy, where the hairs help in a small way to allow the evaporation of sweat, which takes energy from the surrounding skin to do so. I was always hit by arguments like about how unhygienic it was and how much better a shaved leg would be. But I had read that shaved skin was more likely to suffer infection, which just left the questions about aerodynamics, aesthetics and conforming to my peer&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;

Come dice il sito stesso, Brain Pickings è &amp;#8220;uno scrigno del tesoro fatto di mattoncini &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E in quest&amp;#8217;epoca in cui si scopre che Google, dopo tutto, è malvagio come qualsiasi altra mega corporation; in cui non si parla più di &lt;em&gt;amici&lt;/em&gt; perché i &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; ormai sono quelli di Facebook; in cui stimati giornalisti si affidano a Twitter per fare del reportage; in cui i blog più famosi ti danno contenuti superficiali in cambio di qualche click &amp;#8212; e nel frattempo raccolgono informazioni su cosa compri, cosa mangi, con chi esci&lt;sup id="fnref:nota"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; in quest&amp;#8217;epoca è piacevole imbattersi in un sito fatto con cura, che ti arricchisce, ed è assolutamente privo di pubblicità o secondi&amp;nbsp;fini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La newsletter di finesettimana poi è una delizia, perché riporta gli articoli completi e quindi permette una lettura tranquilla, senza costringerti ad inseguire i&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell&amp;#8217;ultima edizione c&amp;#8217;è un bellissimo articolo che mi ha fatto scoprire questi &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/02/07/david-ogilvy-on-writing/"&gt;10 consigli per scrivere bene di David Ogilvy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utili secondo me sia per chi vuol migliorare la propria capacità di scrivere bene sia materiale tecnico (rapporti lavorativi ad esempio) che non (blogs, racconti di viaggio, recensioni di&amp;nbsp;videogiochi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non li traduco in italiano per timore di denudarli della loro&amp;nbsp;efficacia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mather. People who think well, write&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly&amp;nbsp;speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10&amp;nbsp;hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the way you talk.&amp;nbsp;Naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use short words, short sentences and short&amp;nbsp;paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious&amp;nbsp;ass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never write more than two pages on any&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your&amp;nbsp;quotations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning — and then edit&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something important, get a colleague to improve&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACTION&lt;/span&gt;, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a while I was using this old Strathmore paper from fifty years ago that
some guy sent me, it had bad comic art on one side, hacked-out comic work from
1959, 1960, but the paper is superior to anything you can get now. It just
holds the ink better. I ran out of that and now I use this new stuff that’s
not quite as&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

could improve at mental and physical activities until he hit a wall, which “he
cannot by any education or exertion overpass.” In other words, the best we can
do is simply the best we can do. But Ericsson and his colleagues have found
over and over again that with the right kind of effort, that’s rarely the
case. They believe that Galton’s wall often has much less to do with our
innate limits than with what we consider an acceptable level of performance.  They’ve found that top achievers typically follow the same general pattern.
They develop strategies for keeping out of the autonomous stage by doing three
things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented and getting
immediate feedback on their performance […] To improve, we have to be
constantly pushing ourselves beyond where we think our limits lie and then pay
attention to how and why we&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the interviewer asks if he&amp;#8217;s selling&amp;nbsp;out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can I say? I&amp;#8217;d like to see one of these so-called fans. I&amp;#8217;d like to have him blindfolded and brought to me. It&amp;#8217;s like going out to the desert and screaming and then having little kids throw their sandbox at you. I&amp;#8217;m only&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what he answers to the question &amp;#8220;what made you decide to go the rock&amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217;roll&amp;nbsp;route&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carelessness. I lost my one true love. I started drinking. The first thing I know, I&amp;#8217;m in a card game. Then I&amp;#8217;m in a crap game. I wake up in a pool&amp;nbsp;hall&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he goes on and on along this line, really wonderful, crazy stuff; you better read the whole thing for yourself. You only need to be a little misaligned to enjoy&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final&amp;nbsp;quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thing that most people don&amp;#8217;t realize is that it&amp;#8217;s warmer to have long hair. Everybody wants to be warm. People with short hair freeze easily. Then they try to hide their coldness, and they get jealous of everybody that&amp;#8217;s warm. Then they become either barbers or Congressmen. A lot of prison wardens have short&amp;nbsp;hair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(it strikes a chord for me, as I used to have long hair before it all started
to&amp;nbsp;fall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s two years later now, it&amp;#8217;s 2012, and I have absolutely no idea why I linked this word (&amp;#8220;So&amp;#8221;), to the review of a Jonathan Lethem&amp;#8217;s book. No idea at all. I must have gone nuts following the example set by Bob Dylan while I was writing these notes. But I don&amp;#8217;t want to delete this link, because I know there must have been a meaning that I wanted to give, and I don&amp;#8217;t want to lose the hope that someday I will remember why I linked Bob Dylan with Jonathan Lethem.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner commenta (nota 6, p.89): &amp;#8220;These remarks are among the most quoted passages in the Alice books. A recent echo is heard in Jack Kerouac&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;forgettable&lt;/strong&gt; novel, On The Road&amp;nbsp;[&amp;#8230;]&amp;#8221;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner scriveva queste note negli anni &amp;#8216;60, e colpisce questo giudizio perentorio dato a Kerouac, visto che al giorno d&amp;#8217;oggi il libretto di Kerouac e&amp;#8217; considerato come una delle &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html"&gt;colonne portanti della letteratura americana&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quindi: On The Road, forgettable but not entirely forgotten&amp;nbsp;?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oppure: On The Road: vastly overrated&amp;nbsp;?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting piece was published a few days ago on the official google blog: &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html"&gt;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me quote two&amp;nbsp;passages:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much nicer if we had a device with great connectivity that could do searches without interruption.

&lt;p&gt;An interesting piece was published a few days ago on the official google blog: &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html"&gt;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/future-of-search.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me quote two&amp;nbsp;passages:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much nicer if we had a device with great connectivity that could do searches without interruption. One far-fetched idea: how about a wearable device that does searches in the background based on the words it picks up from conversations, and then flashes relevant&amp;nbsp;facts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s our straightforward definition of the ideal search engine? Your best friend with instant access to all the world’s facts and a photographic memory of everything you’ve seen and&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea is (to me) scary as hell. Do I really want the electronic equivalent of the know-it-all friend that is constantly &amp;#8216;flashing&amp;#8217; information, little pieces of knowledge when I try to follow the stream of my thoughts or a conversation with a friend ? No thanks, I&amp;#8217;d rather be alone and do the search later on (and only on things that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; care&amp;nbsp;about).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already feel like too much data is around us. This is like calling for information overload, and the risk is that you won&amp;#8217;t be able to gather your own thinking, your own ideas, because somebody else in the world has already done that. Well that&amp;#8217;s certainly true but then you would become a data collector, or a data linker. A man needs to reinvent the wheel every now and again, otherwise he loses the perception of his inner mental strength, or the ability to think for&amp;nbsp;himself.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quotation then: it sounds like the official definition of search engine according to google. Don&amp;#8217;t you think that it looks very similar to the idea of the superentity that is present in so many science fiction tales ? The superentity that invariably decides to go against humanity (other scenario: tries to help the humanity in its own distorted way, like for example exterminating 99% of the population leaving only the genetically advanced alive)&amp;nbsp;? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>definition of myself</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2006-09-15-definition-of-myself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-15T05:46:00+02:00</published><updated>2006-09-15T05:46:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2006-09-15:/2006-09-15-definition-of-myself.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was browsing &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/"&gt;Merlin Mann&amp;#8217;s 43folders&lt;/a&gt; , and I&amp;#8217;ve stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/"&gt;his definition of geek&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks are often disorganized or have a twisted skein of attention-deficit&amp;nbsp;issues  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks love assessing, classifying, and defining the objects in their&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;geeks crave actionable items and roll their eyes at “mission statements” and lofty management&amp;nbsp;patois&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like things that work with technology-agnostic and lofi&amp;nbsp;tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like frameworks but tend to ignore&amp;nbsp;rules  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks are unusually open to change (if it can be demonstrated to work better than what they’re currently&amp;nbsp;using)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like fixing things on their own&amp;nbsp;terms  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks have too many projects and lots and lots of&amp;nbsp;stuff  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
