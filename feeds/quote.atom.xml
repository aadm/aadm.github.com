&lt;p&gt;We call them hobbies, avocations, callings, passions. These are the noninstrumental activities that help to define us. They reward us with character because they involve an encounter with meaningful resistance — with nature’s laws, with the limits of our own bodies — as in carving wood, melding raw ingredients, fixing a broken appliance, writing code, timing waves or facing the point when the runner’s legs and lungs begin to rebel against him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] Such activities take time, but they also give us time back. They expose us to the risk of frustration and failure, but they also can teach us something about the world and our place in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] We must never forget the joy of doing something slow and something difficult, the satisfaction of not doing what is easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It steals from us one of life’s greatest rewards — the simple pleasure of doing something you merely, but truly, enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] There is also a real and pure joy, a sweet, childlike delight, that comes from just learning and trying to get better. Looking back, you will find that the best years of, say, scuba-diving or doing carpentry were those you spent on the learning curve, when there was exaltation in the mere act of doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…] Lost here is the gentle pursuit of a modest competence, the doing of something just because you enjoy it, not because you are good at it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[..] one of life’s greatest rewards — the simple pleasure of doing something you merely, but truly, enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who reads poetry anyway? Only other poets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Blake Andrews, during an &lt;a href="http://lpvshow.com/the-lpv-show-episode-14-blake-andrews/"&gt;interview with Bryan Formhals&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a strange place to be, this one where I am now. My passion and love for photographs (taking them, editing and discussing and commenting) is something in between two sides that I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side there are all those photographs that most people would judge beautiful, the kind of photographs that appear on glossy magazines, large exhibitions and contests of relevance; think Avedon, McCurry, Leibovitz and the winners of awards like Wildlife Photographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also here another very large group of photographs; someone could say this is blasphemy, but I would put in here also the various shots that make the homepage of Flickr, 500px and Petapixel, i.e. those technically perfect shots of surreal landscapes (blurry skies, ancient ruins, colours like you never see for real, silky smooth water) or beatiful young women with maybe wings on their back, or caressing a swan, swimming in a sea of petals, or some other silly thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are, in other words, the photographs that are easy to enjoy, filled to the brim of fake-happiness, and that would get the approval of my mum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side is where you find most “fine-art” and documentary photography; think prison photography, reportages of drug-addicts with neglected little daughter, terminally ill fathers, war stories obviously, blood and grit and despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the photographs that need to be studied to be enjoyed, or maybe they cannot possibly be enjoyed for what they are and all they do is to provoke some visceral reaction and that’s their end game; this is stuff that my mum would just cast them away mumbling something like “what is this shit”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the two sides I see, and I find myself in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the way I am, I’m naturally inclined to stay the fuck away from benevolence and projecting empty promises of unreal worlds; I have zero interest in using exceptional specimens of human bodies or otherwise “famous” people as the protagonists of my photographs. I don’t care about them, and I don’t care what other people, the public or the judges of a contest for example, may prefer; I shoot for myself only, and maybe a little for my family and friends. I try to stay truthful to what I am, not pursuing fame or attention or economic wealth. So that’s me getting some distance from side #1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I also see the impossibility of being on that other side, where photographs can be good even if they are bad, just because there is a label of social committment or pseudo-artistic bullshit meaning attached to them. I see a lot of hypocrisy in this type of photography, and this was voiced pretty clearly in a &lt;a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2015/3/2/everything-powerful"&gt;great post by Patrick Laroque&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month (read also the comment by Rob Boyer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Patrick and Rob say is that people who are this much into photography, they should be straightforward and say it out loud that they are primarily photographers, and the reason why they go to war zones or slums or other places where normal people would not go, is just because they know they can get emotionally-charged photographs, photographs that will appear on newspapers, stuff that will be different from anything else the world has seen before. Making the world a better place? Yeah, maybe… but I think you should really be a doctor if you truly want to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/magazine/what-can-a-pregnant-photojournalist-cover-everything.html"&gt;this great article by Lynsey D’Addario&lt;/a&gt;, an action-photographer-goddess (soon to be featured in a movie with none other than  the Mockingjay, i.e. Jennifer Lawrence — the most appropriate actress for this part). What I see is that photographers like Lynsey are thrill-seeking people, adventurers in the broadest sense, that go places and do stuff that others don’t. I actually respect people that are honest with their intentions like Lynsey, primarily because they shoot &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; photographs and that’s what they care — and that’s what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; care, so we’re even. But most photographers see a way to reposition themselves, avoding being called jerks because they go to these dangerous places &lt;em&gt;only to take stupid photographs&lt;/em&gt; they can label themselves not as the ‘crazy ones’ but as the new evangelists, shedding light on the most distressing stories this world is full of;  to be portayed as they are inherently better than us and they want to teach us some moral but I can see it’s all fake, just a post-it note attached to your photographs retrospectively, to somehow justify the silliness of it all (being away from your family that may need you more than your photographs for example), to hide the profound egoism that is the mark of success in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this camp however there is the idea that people should add a heavy patina of good-will and moral teachings to their photographs otherwise they have no merit. And this leads to the absurdity of seeing bad photographs in the spotlight and plauded just because they have social meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so here I am, somewhere in the middle, doing photographs that I like, my wife likes, my mum not so much unless I do something really easy like shooting a marina at dusk. My photographs show no other committment except being true to my family and who I am; I take photographs because I enjoy the act of creating images out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for me, Susan Sontag gives me hope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photographic seeing meant an aptitude for discovering beauty in what everybody sees but neglects as too ordinary.
[…] The proper moment is when one can see thngs in a fresh way
While most people taking photographs are only seconding received notions of the beautiful, ambitious professionals usually think they are challenging them. According to heroic modernists like Weston, the photographer’s venture is elitist, prophetic, subversive, revelatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is another side to be part of, maybe it’s the one where the late Saul Leiter happens to be, together with Jay Meisel and Patrick Laroque. I wonder if there’s any space left; must be pretty tight, squeezed between those two larger sides.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="photo"></category><category term="notes"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>still finding true gems online</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2014-10-27-still-finding-true-gems-online.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-10-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2014-10-27:/2014-10-27-still-finding-true-gems-online.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Months ago &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/103970774611658298842/posts/FFZS29nwkHh"&gt;I asked the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt; community&lt;/a&gt; about their online reading habits.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my idea is that yes, books give you something else, something that takes you away for longer times, requiring a committment to the act of reading and comprehension that is essential if you really want to go deep into a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the blogs I read are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; useful and fun and clever and insightful; in other words, I love “my” bloggers (how bad this word sounds to me now that I spell it out; I’d love to simply call them “writers” — and for a short list of them &lt;a href="#addendum-my-favourite-photography-blogs-circa-2014"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that I have found another one brilliant writer, and I’m simply astounded he doesn’t have more recognition or traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joerg Colberg is the man. He maintains and writes this wonderful blog, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;Conscientious Photography Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, and apparently he’s been doing this for 12 years! So there’s this incredible archive of clever, well written reviews and opinion pieces and everything else on photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, just to give you an idea on how brilliant Mr Colberg really is, there is a piece &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/on_process/"&gt;On Process&lt;/a&gt; that people like &lt;a href="http://jefferysaddoris.com/"&gt;Jefferey Saddoris&lt;/a&gt; (one of the two &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/otp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosts) would get a kick out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am not gonna do any synopsis since it would be a waste of time — plus he writes so much better than me. But there is a passage that I liked a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you’re lugging around an 8x10 camera or that you photographing your computer screen is pretty much irrelevant for the evaluation of your work. Unless, of course, we want to treat photography like a craft. But I don’t think that’s so interesting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting piece that got me very excited is &lt;a href="http://jmcolberg.com/weblog/extended/archives/photography_after_photography"&gt;“Photography after photography”&lt;/a&gt;, 
because it’s all about answering the question “where do we go from here”? I mean, do we still hang tight to the conventions established by the masters? Is really photography stagnating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so interesting to me even though I may be so boringly classical in my compositions and photography; this piece was (and still is!) like a corkscrew that opened my head and instilled some ideas that I’d like to go and test them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again a small excerpt (hoping that Mr. Colberg doesn’t mind):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography has finally arrived at its own existential crisis. I[t is far from being over - no medium is ever over as long as there is just an ounce of creativity left on this planet. […] But photography has long been running in a circle. Over the past ten years, it has increasingly become dominated by nostalgia and conservatism. Even the idea that we now need editors or curators to create meaning out of the flood of photographs ultimately is conservative, looking backwards when we could, no we should be looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is digital photography that has resulted in the current stasis of the medium. Given the possibilities, it is quite amazing to see how little digital photography has qualitatively changed photography. Quantitatively, oh sure. The number of photographs taken has exploded, especially since there are now cameras in places where there weren’t any before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;addendum: my favourite photography blogs, circa 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, my favourite blogs are still largely the same I was reading two years ago — which is incredible in internet shelf-life terms. It is also reassuring to follow people who are truly passionate in what they do and are not obsessed with today’s mantra (monetization!) so that years on they still produce vivid and interesting pieces to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is my short photo-related bookmark list (in no particular order):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick Laroque, &lt;a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog"&gt;http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog&lt;/a&gt; (love his style and the quirky and sometimes very poetic write ups; also very knowledgeable in all technical aspects)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob Boyer, &lt;a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com"&gt;http://photo.rwboyer.com&lt;/a&gt; (I like his technical insights, his wonderfully funny rants against fuji, nikon, whatever, and the thing is that I like his blog even if I’m not really interested in photographing models which is all he does apparently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ming Thein, &lt;a href="http://blog.mingthein.com"&gt;http://blog.mingthein.com&lt;/a&gt; (I would like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; to like his blog, because he’s too knowledgeable, confident and successful for for my taste, plus he’s only 28! — but what he brings to the table is honesty and integrity and an incredibly professional attitude towards maintaing the blog with frequent updates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gregory Simpson, &lt;a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography"&gt;http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography&lt;/a&gt; (he is just the kind of writer that I wish I was, truly doing his stuff with seemingly no care about what the current rend is — and I love it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Johnston, &lt;a href="http://theonlinephotographer.com"&gt;http://theonlinephotographer.com&lt;/a&gt; (he has probably the most competent community commenting his articles. I dont care too much for his football insights or other stuff like that, but I find a lot of good information in there, just a shame that his blog is so outdated graphically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joerg Colberg, &lt;a href="http://cphmag.com"&gt;http://cphmag.com&lt;/a&gt; (read above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to equate the act of  scrolling down one’s facebook or twitter updates with passively watching tv. I think the first is the modern day’s equivalent of the latter — and to be completely honest I have to say that many many times I have induldged in the brainless and compulsive checking of the damned feeds. That is why &lt;a href="2010-08-03-farewell-facebook.html"&gt;I gave up on Facebook years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I will do the same with linkedin soon — and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aadmtwi"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; so far remains the only connection that I have with anything “social”. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota-passive-watching-tv" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an article on the New York Times about the latest Spider-Man movie (the one filmed by Marc Webb):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gwen Stacy asks Peter Parker if he likes branzino: you know, “Like, the fish?”.&lt;br/&gt;
Then she invites him to dinner, where everyone is saying “branzino”: Denis Leary (playing Gwen’s dad), Peter, Gwen again. We see a full branzino at the dinner table, neatly plated.&lt;br/&gt;
Why branzino? The film never says — it just offers up this delightful serving of unexpected weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the comments, a guy who does not forget to specify his title writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branzino is a New England cold water fish that is usually thrown out, but many restaurants and people interested in ecology believe its use may be a viable way to help reduce the destruction to cod, flounder and other more popular North Atlantic fish whose numbers [and size] are dwindling. There is a belief this will also be a long term benefit to the smaller family fishing economy in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;N.E.&lt;/span&gt; It was in all probability an ecology statement….and Dennis Leary is a true New Englander.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David M. Klein, Ph.D. South Florida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for avoiding internet anonimity because it causes all sort of animal behaviour (see any internet forum debating politics or canon vs nikon merits or iphone vs android).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to specify to the world that you are a friggin Ph.D like if it gives more credit to your ideas, this I cannot stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this so often in work emails — and that’s bad enough, but if you use it also when commenting some innocuous sentence about branzino (which is by the way not New England specific as I have been raised with branzino or spigola, and I’m from Bari, Puglia) then you just sound like a pretentious dick.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category><category term="notes"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>wildlife photographer of the year</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-11-05:/2012-11-05-wildlife-photographer.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Si tratta probabilmente dell’unica mostra a cui vado volentieri.

&lt;p&gt;Rispetto all’edizione del 2009 che vidi a Londra, le foto qui sono stampate e non visualizzate su pannelli &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; retroilluminati; all’epoca mi colpì molto la resa su questi schermi retroilluminati (non eravamo forse ancora abituati agli iPad) ma comunque nulla da dire — le stampe sono sempre affascinanti e in questo caso anche ben illuminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le didascalie che accompagnano ogni foto sono piene di informazioni tecniche (macchina utilizzata, eventuali supporti, flash, e altro ancora) e viene anche raccontata la storia dietro ogni scatto. Ma qui temo che i curatori (o magari gli stessi fotografi) si siano lasciati prendere la mano. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Stephane took two hours to walk to Creux du Van in western Switzerland, laden with heavy equipment.”&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/prevPhoto.do?photo=2769&amp;amp;year=2011&amp;amp;category=12"&gt;Celestial arch&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insomma, se non fatichi un po’, pare che la giuria non ti prenda in considerazione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sto dunque valutando se partecipare il prossimo anno con queste due fotografie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Erano mesi che inseguivo questa volpe nella ostile campagna Piemontese. Volevo catturare una immagine forte che simboleggiasse i pericoli continui che fronteggiano questo ormai sparuto gruppo di bestie selvatiche, inseguite dalle micidiali armi del progresso. Ma questa volpe era incredibilmente furba e riusciva sempre a schivare tutte le auto. Quindi alla fine presi la situazione in pugno, preparai un complesso sistema di quattro flash, due pannelli riflettenti, tre Nikon D4 che avrebbero scattato in modo sincrono per documentare l’avvenuto (e tirai pure fuori l’iPhone che non si sa mai); poi mi misi sul mio &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt;, partii a razzo e finalmente tirai sotto questa maledettissima volpe”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Erano dieci giorni che saltavo il dolce per trovare un momento senza nessun fottuto turista. Con grande coraggio, un giorno saltai anche il secondo e finalmente riuscii ad avere cinque minuti di solitudine a tu per tu col feroce e rapidissimo camaleonte malgascio, che fotografai con la mia Canon 1D e  105mm Macro f/1.4 (e tirai fuori l’iPhone che non si sa mai)”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="photo"></category><category term="quote"></category><category term="notes"></category></entry><entry><title>notes on parenting</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2012-08-09-notes-on-parenting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-08-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2012-08-09:/2012-08-09-notes-on-parenting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been reading quite a lof of articles about parenting.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these articles are (as usual) very well written and are full of ideas that I have enjoyed. I want to keep updating this post every time I find something good. They may also help a future me because you never know what’s behind the corner of becoming a dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 1: “Spoiled Rotten” by Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;L.A.&lt;/span&gt; families observed, no child routinely performed household chores without being instructed to. Often, the kids had to be begged to attempt the simplest tasks; often, they still refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Yanira had no clear role in the group, she quickly found ways to make herself useful. Twice a day, she swept the sand off the sleeping mats, and she helped stack the kapashi leaves for transport back to the village. In the evening, she fished for crustaceans, which she cleaned, boiled, and served to the others. Calm and self-possessed, Yanira “asked for nothing,” Izquierdo later recalled. The girl’s behavior made a strong impression on the anthropologist because at the time of the trip Yanira was just six years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Most parents today were brought up in a culture that put a strong emphasis on being special, (…) being special takes hard work and can’t be trusted to children. Hence the exhausting cycle of constantly monitoring their work and performance, which in turn makes children feel less competent and confident, so that they need even more oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) today’s incoming freshmen are less likely to be concerned about the rigors of higher education than “about how they will handle the logistics of everyday life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children, according to “Life at Home,” are disproportionate generators of clutter: “Each new child in a household leads to a 30 percent increase in a family’s inventory of possessions during the preschool years alone.” Many of the kids’ rooms pictured are so crowded with clothes and toys, so many of which have been tossed on the floor, that there is no path to the bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 2: “Raising Successful Children” by Madeline Levine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central task of growing up is to develop a sense of self that is autonomous, confident and generally in accord with reality. If you treat your walking toddler as if she can’t walk, you diminish her confidence and distort reality. Ditto nightly “reviews” of homework, repetitive phone calls to “just check if you’re O.K.” and “editing” (read: writing) your child’s college application essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanging back and allowing children to make mistakes is one of the greatest challenges of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having tutors prep your anxious 3-year-old for a preschool interview because all your friends’ children are going to this particular school or pushing your exhausted child to take one more advanced-placement course because it will ensure her spot as class valedictorian is not involved parenting but toxic overparenting aimed at meeting the parents’ need for status or affirmation and not the child’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) the child’s job is to grow, yours is to control your anxiety so it doesn’t get in the way of his reasonable moves toward autonomy (…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents also have to make sure their own lives are fulfilling. There is no parent more vulnerable to the excesses of overparenting than an unhappy parent One of the most important things we do for our children is to present them with a version of adult life that is appealing and worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 3: “How to Raise a Child” By Judith Warner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) schools that worship at the altar of high achievement but do everything they can to undermine children’s growth and well-being: eliminating recess; assigning mind-deadening amounts of homework; and ranking, measuring and valuing kids by narrowly focused test scores, while cutting out other areas of creative education in which large numbers of students who don’t necessarily test well might find success and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(…) the inconvenient truth remains that not every child can be shaped and accelerated into Harvard material. But all kids can have their spirits broken, depression induced and anxiety stoked by too much stress, too little downtime and too much attention given to external factors that make them look good to an audience of appraising eyes but leave them feeling rotten inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;excerpt 4: “America’s Top Parent - What’s behind the Tiger Mother craze?”  by Elizabeth Kolbert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chua, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, is a Yale Law School professor. She is married to another Yale law professor and has two daughters, whom she drives relentlessly (…) In Chua’s binary world, there are just two kinds of mother. There are “Chinese mothers,” who, she allows, do not necessarily have to be Chinese (…) Then, there are “Western” mothers. (…) Chua chooses the instruments that her daughters will play and stands over them as they practice for three, four, sometimes five hours at a stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Yes, you can brute-force any kid to learn to play the piano—just precisely like his or her billion neighbors” is how one of the comments on the Wall Street Journal’s Web site put it. “But you’ll never get a Jimi Hendrix that way”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about the only category in which American students outperform the competition is self-regard (…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting is hard. As anyone who has gone through the process and had enough leisure (and still functioning brain cells) to reflect on it knows, a lot of it is a crapshoot. Things go wrong that you have no control over, and, on occasion, things also go right, and you have no control over those, either. The experience is scary and exhilarating and often humiliating, not because you’re disappointed in your kids, necessarily, but because you’re disappointed in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About cyclists (especially roadies) shaving their legs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was based on sound principles of physics and human anatomy, where the hairs help in a small way to allow the evaporation of sweat, which takes energy from the surrounding skin to do so. I was always hit by arguments like about how unhygienic it was and how much better a shaved leg would be. But I had read that shaved skin was more likely to suffer infection, which just left the questions about aerodynamics, aesthetics and conforming to my peer group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si chiama &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org"&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; ed è come se fossero i ritagli di giornale che vorresti mettere da parte; parla di creatività, di scienza, di filosofia, di psicologia; parla di qualsiasi argomento interessi la sua creatrice Maria Popova, di qualsiasi cosa che stimoli la sua curiosità. Come dice il sito stesso, Brain Pickings è “uno scrigno del tesoro fatto di mattoncini &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E in quest’epoca in cui si scopre che Google, dopo tutto, è malvagio come qualsiasi altra mega corporation; in cui non si parla più di &lt;em&gt;amici&lt;/em&gt; perché i &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt; ormai sono quelli di Facebook; in cui stimati giornalisti si affidano a Twitter per fare del reportage; in cui i blog più famosi ti danno contenuti superficiali in cambio di qualche click — e nel frattempo raccolgono informazioni su cosa compri, cosa mangi, con chi esci&lt;sup id="fnref:nota"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:nota"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; in quest’epoca è piacevole imbattersi in un sito fatto con cura, che ti arricchisce, ed è assolutamente privo di pubblicità o secondi fini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La newsletter di finesettimana poi è una delizia, perché riporta gli articoli completi e quindi permette una lettura tranquilla, senza costringerti ad inseguire i links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nell’ultima edizione c’è un bellissimo articolo che mi ha fatto scoprire questi &lt;a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/02/07/david-ogilvy-on-writing/"&gt;10 consigli per scrivere bene di David Ogilvy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utili secondo me sia per chi vuol migliorare la propria capacità di scrivere bene sia materiale tecnico (rapporti lavorativi ad esempio) che non (blogs, racconti di viaggio, recensioni di videogiochi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non li traduco in italiano per timore di denudarli della loro efficacia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mather. People who think well, write well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10 hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the way you talk. Naturally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never write more than two pages on any subject.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your quotations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning — and then edit it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACTION&lt;/span&gt;, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

For a while I was using this old Strathmore paper from fifty years ago that
some guy sent me, it had bad comic art on one side, hacked-out comic work from
1959, 1960, but the paper is superior to anything you can get now. It just
holds the ink better. I ran out of that and now I use this new stuff that’s
not quite as good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his 1869 book &lt;em&gt;Hereditary Genius&lt;/em&gt; Sir Francis Galton argued that a person
could improve at mental and physical activities until he hit a wall, which “he
cannot by any education or exertion overpass.” In other words, the best we can
do is simply the best we can do. But Ericsson and his colleagues have found
over and over again that with the right kind of effort, that’s rarely the
case. They believe that Galton’s wall often has much less to do with our
innate limits than with what we consider an acceptable level of performance.  They’ve found that top achievers typically follow the same general pattern.
They develop strategies for keeping out of the autonomous stage by doing three
things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented and getting
immediate feedback on their performance […] To improve, we have to be
constantly pushing ourselves beyond where we think our limits lie and then pay
attention to how and why we fail.&lt;/p&gt;

know if Bob Dylan was totally out of his mind or if he was just playing crazy,
but this 1966 interview is brilliant stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the interviewer asks if he’s selling out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can I say? I’d like to see one of these so-called fans. I’d like to have him blindfolded and brought to me. It’s like going out to the desert and screaming and then having little kids throw their sandbox at you. I’m only 24.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what he answers to the question “what made you decide to go the rock’n’roll route”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carelessness. I lost my one true love. I started drinking. The first thing I know, I’m in a card game. Then I’m in a crap game. I wake up in a pool hall…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he goes on and on along this line, really wonderful, crazy stuff; you better read the whole thing for yourself. You only need to be a little misaligned to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thing that most people don’t realize is that it’s warmer to have long hair. Everybody wants to be warm. People with short hair freeze easily. Then they try to hide their coldness, and they get jealous of everybody that’s warm. Then they become either barbers or Congressmen. A lot of prison wardens have short hair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(it strikes a chord for me, as I used to have long hair before it all started
to fall).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s two years later now, it’s 2012, and I have absolutely no idea why I linked this word (“So”), to the review of a Jonathan Lethem’s book. No idea at all. I must have gone nuts following the example set by Bob Dylan while I was writing these notes. But I don’t want to delete this link, because I know there must have been a meaning that I wanted to give, and I don’t want to lose the hope that someday I will remember why I linked Bob Dylan with Jonathan Lethem. &lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:nota" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go”, said the Cat  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner commenta (nota 6, p.89): “These remarks are among the most quoted passages in the Alice books. A recent echo is heard in Jack Kerouac’s &lt;strong&gt;forgettable&lt;/strong&gt; novel, On The Road […]”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardner scriveva queste note negli anni ‘60, e colpisce questo giudizio perentorio dato a Kerouac, visto che al giorno d’oggi il libretto di Kerouac e’ considerato come una delle &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html"&gt;colonne portanti della letteratura americana&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me quote two passages:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be much nicer if we had a device with great connectivity that could do searches without interruption. One far-fetched idea: how about a wearable device that does searches in the background based on the words it picks up from conversations, and then flashes relevant facts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s our straightforward definition of the ideal search engine? Your best friend with instant access to all the world’s facts and a photographic memory of everything you’ve seen and know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea is (to me) scary as hell. Do I really want the electronic equivalent of the know-it-all friend that is constantly ‘flashing’ information, little pieces of knowledge when I try to follow the stream of my thoughts or a conversation with a friend ? No thanks, I’d rather be alone and do the search later on (and only on things that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; care about).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already feel like too much data is around us. This is like calling for information overload, and the risk is that you won’t be able to gather your own thinking, your own ideas, because somebody else in the world has already done that. Well that’s certainly true but then you would become a data collector, or a data linker. A man needs to reinvent the wheel every now and again, otherwise he loses the perception of his inner mental strength, or the ability to think for himself.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second quotation then: it sounds like the official definition of search engine according to google. Don’t you think that it looks very similar to the idea of the superentity that is present in so many science fiction tales ? The superentity that invariably decides to go against humanity (other scenario: tries to help the humanity in its own distorted way, like for example exterminating 99% of the population leaving only the genetically advanced alive) ? &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="notes"></category><category term="tech"></category><category term="quote"></category></entry><entry><title>definition of myself</title><link href="http://aadm.github.io/2006-09-15-definition-of-myself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2006-09-15T05:46:00+02:00</published><updated>2006-09-15T05:46:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Amato del Monte</name></author><id>tag:aadm.github.io,2006-09-15:/2006-09-15-definition-of-myself.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was browsing &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/"&gt;Merlin Mann’s 43folders&lt;/a&gt; , and I’ve stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/"&gt;his definition of geek&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;geeks are often disorganized or have a twisted skein of attention-deficit issues  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks love assessing, classifying, and defining the objects in their world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks crave actionable items and roll their eyes at “mission statements” and lofty management patois&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like things that work with technology-agnostic and lofi tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like frameworks but tend to ignore rules  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks are unusually open to change (if it can be demonstrated to work better than what they’re currently using)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks like fixing things on their own terms  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;geeks have too many projects and lots and lots of stuff  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
