I have been doing some experiments with this "stitching-bokeh" method; a neat idea to get the look of a medium-format camera but it takes too much computer work to get a good result; this is one of my attempts, definetely [not as flashy as Brenizer's](http://www.ryanbrenizer.com/category/brenizer-method/), and I am pretty sure only a minimal percentage of viewers would spot something 'different' here:

The other photographs that I have collected for this ninth installment have been taken during the past few days in Parma; two days of sunshine and then two rainy days. These are the rainy days photographs[^1].
