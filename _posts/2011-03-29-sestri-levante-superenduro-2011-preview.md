Had a great day of riding last Saturday. Woke up at 6:30am, took the 7:39
train to Sestri Levante. Three hours or so, and then here I am in Sestri; cool
breeze, warm sunshine, I started following the Superenduro signs. Here's a few
pics that sum up the day.

_Where all the special stages begin_.

(And PS1, 2 and 3 were gone in a second; too much fun to stop).

_Some pics of PS4_: they're all for you, Phil.

_Steep and rocky trails_: classical mediterranean, but PS 1 and 3 are in the woods, on dirt and roots.

_Almost the end of PS4_: you see the town and the sea below, but there's no
time to relax, there's still a long and tough pedally section on loose rocks.

_Total relax_: well deserved after riding [these tough and technical trails](http://connect.garmin.com/activity/75787468).

_Farinata_: halfway between pizza and focaccia, there's no other place outside Liguria where you can eat a slice of farinata.
