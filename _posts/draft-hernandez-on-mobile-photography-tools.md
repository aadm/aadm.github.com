This guy Hernandez made this video asking if "mobile photography has made us more reliant on tools than on our eyes":

Sometimes youtube comments carry more weight than the video itself. For example this guy is absolutely right:

> Hernandez makes a valid point - the image shouldn't be defined by the cameraï»¿ it's captured with. It's a shame he had to spend five minutes saying what he could easily have said in five seconds. I turned off after that - couldn't take the pretentiousness of his language any more.

I agree with this comment more than I agree with Hernandez. He created a cool video (was it all his merit though? I see a CNN logo on the corner, and no credits for music, editing etc.), he said some interesting things but it was all ruined by his boring and pompous delivery. I also wanted the video to be at least six minutes shorter. I have something against these video "essays"; they are very effective and I like the way clever editing can make a jumble of words and illustrations and short video clips flow like if it was  a whole.

But while watching this I sensed not much logical connections between a though and the next.  If this was written I am pretty sure it couldn't stand on its feet. I had the impression of listening to fake poetry, where words are put one after the other just because they sound good..

But what do I know, I have never been able to read poetry.
