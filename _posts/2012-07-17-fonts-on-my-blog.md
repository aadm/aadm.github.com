Last time [I wrote something about this blog](2012-07-12-moving-to-github.html), how I moved everything to Jekyll and modified the original themes. 

Then Ian [tweeted about that issue that I had with the fonts](https://twitter.com/largeuk/status/223700925959770112), that the blog looked differently when viewed on a PC or a Mac. And he also added that embedding fonts was easy.

So I looked around and in fact it was easy; more importantly, there's plenty of open source fonts [made available by Google](http://www.google.com/webfonts/). What was *not* easy was to decide which combination of fonts to use.

I have found these places particularly helpful in teaching me a crash course on typography:

* <http://designshack.net/articles/css/10-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy>
* <http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxm22/fonts>
* <http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type>
* <http://sachagreif.com/google-webfonts-that-dont-suck>

At the end I had two options: [Quicksand](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Quicksand) (headings) and [Quattrocento Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Quattrocento+Sans) (body), or [Averia Sans Libre](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Averia+Sans+Libre) + Quattrocento Sans.

So no doubts on the body font -- even though all these knowledgeable people that have written reasonable and reasoned pieces on these Google fonts have had nothing to say on Quattrocento Sans so there *must* be something not right. But I can't see it.

For the headings, as of today, Averia Sans Libre won.
