Last time [I wrote something about this blog](2012-07-12-moving-to-github.html), how I moved everything to Jekyll and modified the original themes. 

Then a friend tweeted about that issue that I had with the fonts, that the blog looked differently when viewed on a PC or a Mac. And he also added that it was "fairly easy to add fonts".

So I looked around and in fact it was easy; more importantly, there's plenty of open source fonts [made available by Google](http://www.google.com/webfonts/). What was *not* easy was to decide which combination of fonts to use.

I have found these places particularly helpful in teaching me a crash course on typography:

* <http://designshack.net/articles/css/10-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy>
* <http://www.personal.psu.edu/jxm22/fonts>
* <http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type>
* <http://sachagreif.com/google-webfonts-that-dont-suck>

At the end I had two options: Quicksand (headings) and Quattrocento Sans (body), or Averia Sans Libre + Quattrocento Sans.

You can see that I had no doubts on the body font; problem is that none of these designers that have written something meaningful on Google Webfonts have had anything to say on this font so I suspect there must be something not quite right. But I can't see it.

For the headings, as of today, Averia Sans Libre won.
