Somehow (twitter maybe ?) I've found the transcript of [an interview to Bob Dylan](http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/66-jan.htm) which appeared on Playboy in 1966.

[So](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/books/review/Cowles-t.html), I don't
know if Bob Dylan was totally out of his mind or if he was just playing crazy,
but this 1966 interview is brilliant stuff.

For example, the interviewer asks if he's selling out:

_What can I say? I'd like to see one of these so-called fans. I'd like to have
him blindfolded and brought to me. It's like going out to the desert and
screaming and then having little kids throw their sandbox at you. I'm only
24._

Or what he answers to the question "what made you decide to go the rock-'n'-roll
route".

Well, you better read the whole thing for yourself. If only need to be a
little misaligned to enjoy it.

Final quote:

_The thing that most people don't realize is that it's warmer to have long
hair. Everybody wants to be warm. People with short hair freeze easily. Then
they try to hide their coldness, and they get jealous of everybody that's
warm. Then they become either barbers or Congressmen. A lot of prison wardens
have short hair._

(it strikes a chord for me, as I used to have long hair before it all started
to fall).
