[Making a really good coffee]()

[Interesting post on Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=science-in-the-neighborhood-how-to-2011-03-08), however this barista needs a reality check: a refractometer to make coffee ? I'd recommend a couple of place in my hometown (Bari) where
baristas have no PhD but make the best coffee ever.
