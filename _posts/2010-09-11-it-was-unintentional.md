I swear it was unintentional. Second post straight after [this one where I
blurbed about my next camera](http://aadm.calepin.co/my-next-
camera.html), and here it is, the GF-1 in my hands.

So how did it happen: I spent last weekend in Livigno for some mtb'ing
(saturday, cross-country trail, about 50km and 1365m elevation change; sunday,
intense session at the bike park). On sunday afternoon, half an hour before
end of business, I went into a shop and asked for the Panasonic GF-1. They had
only the body. They sold the 20mm which was part of the kit. So I asked, maybe
you have a spare 17mm from some Olympus body ?

And yes they did. And so this is how I ended up with a rather unusual bundle.
I know, the Olympus 17mm f/2.8 is not the same thing as the Panasonic 20mm
f/1.7. But you see, in Livigno they have no IVA (equivalent of UK's VAT). And
they made a very good price. An offer I couldn't refuse.
